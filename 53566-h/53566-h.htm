  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>THE BLUE ENVELOPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Leaning back in my chair, I smoked my
morning cigar and watched Uncle Nelson
open his mail. He had an old-fashioned
way of doing this: holding the envelope
in his left hand, clipping its right edge with
his desk shears, and then removing the
inclosure and carefully reading it before he
returned it to its original envelope. Across
one end he would make a memorandum
of the contents, after which the letters were
placed in a neat pile.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I watched him methodically working,
Uncle Nelson raised a large blue envelope,
clipped its end, and read the inclosure
with an appearance of unusual interest.
Then, instead of adding it to the letters
before him, he laid it aside; and a few
minutes later reverted to it again, giving
the letter a second careful perusal. Deeply
musing, for a time he sat motionless in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>chair. Then, arousing himself from his
deep abstraction, he cast a fleeting glance
in my direction and composedly resumed
his task.</p>

<p class='c000'>I knew Uncle Nelson’s habits so well
that this affair of the blue envelope told
me plainly the communication was of unusual
importance. Yet the old gentleman
calmly continued his work until every
letter the mail contained was laid in a pile
before him and fully docketed. With the
last he suddenly swung around in his chair
and faced me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robert,” said he, “how would you
like to go to Brazil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lacking a ready answer to this blunt
question I simply stared at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“De Pintra has written me,” he continued—“do
you know of Dom Miguel
de Pintra?” I shook my head. “He is
one of the oldest customers of the house.
His patronage assisted us in getting established.
We are under deep obligations
to de Pintra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not remember seeing his name
upon the books,” I said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“No; before you came into the firm
he had retired from business—for he is a
wealthy man. But I believe this retirement
has been bad for him. His energetic
nature would not allow him to remain
idle, and he has of late substituted politics
for business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is not so bad,” I remarked,
lightly. “Some people make a business
of politics, and often it proves a fairly
successful one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>My uncle nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here in New Orleans, yes,” he acknowledged;
“but things are vastly different
in Brazil. I am sorry to say that Dom
Miguel is a leader of the revolutionists.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah,” said I, impressed by his grave
tone. And I added: “I have supposed
that Dom Pedro is secure upon his throne,
and personally beloved by his subjects.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is doubtless secure enough,” returned
Uncle Nelson, dryly, “but, although
much respected by his people, there is, I
believe, serious opposition to an imperial
form of government. Rebellions have been
numerous during his reign. Indeed, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>people of Brazil seem rapidly becoming
republicans in principle, and it is to establish
a republican form of government that
my friend de Pintra has placed himself at
the head of a conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good for de Pintra!” I cried, heartily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, no; it is bad,” he rejoined, with
a frown. “There is always danger in opposing
established monarchies, and in this
case the Emperor of Brazil has the countenance
of both Europe and America.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As I ventured no reply to this he paused,
and again regarded me earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe you are the very person,
Robert, I should send de Pintra. He
wishes me to secure for him a secretary
whom he may trust implicitly. At present,
he writes me, he is surrounded by the
emperor’s spies. Even the members of his
own household may be induced to betray
him. Indeed, I imagine my old friend in
a very hot-bed of intrigue and danger. Yet
he believes he could trust an American who
has no partiality for monarchies and no
inducement to sympathize with any party
but his own. Will you go, Robert?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The question, abrupt though it was,
did not startle me. Those accustomed to
meet Nelson Harcliffe’s moods must think
quickly. Still, I hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you spare me, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not very well,” he admitted. “You
have relieved me of many of the tedious
details of business since you came home
from college. But, for de Pintra’s sake,
I am not only willing you should go, but
I ask you, as a personal favor, to hasten to
Rio and serve my friend faithfully, protecting
him, so far as you may be able, from
the dangers he is facing. You will find
him a charming fellow—a noble man,
indeed—and he needs just such a loyal
assistant as I believe you will prove. Will
you go, Robert?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Uncle Nelson’s sudden proposal gave
me a thrill of eager interest best explained
by that fascinating word “danger.” Five
minutes before I would have smiled at the
suggestion that I visit a foreign country on
so quixotic an errand; but the situation
was, after all, as simple as it was sudden in
development, and my uncle’s earnest voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and eyes emphasized his request in no
uncertain manner. Would I go? Would
I, a young man on the threshold of life,
with pulses readily responding to the suggestion
of excitement and adventure, leave
my humdrum existence in a mercantile
establishment to mingle in the intrigues of
a nation striving to cast off the shackles of
a monarchy and become free and independent?
My answer was assured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, we Harcliffes are chary
of exhibiting emotion. Any eagerness on
my part would, I felt, have seriously displeased
my reserved and deliberate uncle.
Therefore I occupied several minutes in
staring thoughtfully through the open window
before I finally swung around in my
chair and answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, Uncle, I will go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” said he, a flush of pleasure
spreading over his fine old face. Then
he turned again to the letter in the blue
envelope. “The Castina sails on Wednesday,
I see, and Dom Miguel wishes his new
secretary to go on her. Therefore you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>must interview Captain Lertine at once,
and arrange for passage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I took my hat, returned my uncle’s
grave bow, and left the office.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>VALCOUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Castina was a Brazilian trading-ship
frequently employed by the firm of
Harcliffe Brothers to transport merchandise
from New Orleans to Rio de Janiero.
I had formed a slight acquaintance with
the master, Pedro Lertine, and was not
surprised when he placed his own state-room
at my disposal; for although the
vessel usually carried passengers, the cabin
accommodations were none of the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Captain asked no questions concerning
my voyage, contenting himself with
the simple statement that he had often
carried my father with him in the Castina
in former years, and was now pleased to
welcome the son aboard. He exhibited
rare deference toward my uncle, Nelson
Harcliffe, as the head of our firm, when the
old gentleman came to the head of the levee
to bid me good by; this Uncle Nelson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>did by means of a gentle pressure of my
hand. I am told the Harcliffes are always
remarkable for their reserve, and certainly
the head of our house was an adept at
repressing his emotions. Neither he nor
my father, who had been his associate in
founding the successful mercantile establishment,
had ever cared to make any
intimate friends; and for this reason the
warmth of friendship evinced by Uncle
Nelson in sending me on this peculiar mission
to Dom Miguel de Pintra had caused
me no little astonishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>After his simple handshake my uncle
walked back to his office, and I immediately
boarded the Castina to look after the placing
of my trunks. Before I had fairly settled
myself in my cozy state-room we were under
way and steaming down the river toward
the open sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>On deck I met a young gentleman of
rather prepossessing personality who seemed
quite willing to enter into conversation. He
was a dark-eyed, handsome Brazilian, well
dressed and of pleasing manners. His
card bore the inscription, <em>Manuel Cortes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>de Guarde</em>. He expressed great delight at
finding me able to speak his native tongue,
and rendered himself so agreeable that we
had soon established very cordial relations.
He loved to talk, and I love to listen,
especially when I am able to gather information
by so doing, and de Guarde seemed
to know Brazil perfectly, and to delight in
describing it. I noticed that he never
touched on politics, but from his general
conversation I gleaned considerable knowledge
of the country I was about to visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>During dinner he chattered away continually
in his soft Portuguese patois, and
the other passengers, less than a dozen in
number, seemed content to allow him to
monopolize the conversation. I noticed
that Captain Lertine treated de Guarde
with fully as much consideration as he did
me, while the other passengers he seemed
to regard with haughty indifference. However,
I made the acquaintance of several
of my fellow-voyagers and found them both
agreeable and intelligent.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had promised myself a pleasant, quiet
voyage to the shores of Brazil, but presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>events began to happen with a rapidity
that startled me. Indeed, it was not long
before I received a plain intimation that I
had embarked upon an adventure that
might prove dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were two days out, and the night
fell close and warm. Finding my berth
insufferably oppressive I arose about midnight,
partially dressed, and went on deck
to get whatever breeze might be stirring.
It was certainly cooler than below, and
reclining in the shadow beside a poop I had
nearly succeeded in falling asleep when
aroused by the voices of two men who
approached and paused to lean over the
taffrail. They proved to be Captain Lertine
and de Guarde, and I was about to
announce my presence when the mention
of my own name caused me to hesitate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot understand why you should
suspect young Harcliffe,” the Captain said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because, of all your passengers, he
would be most fitted to act as de Pintra’s
secretary,” was the reply. “And, moreover,
he is a Harcliffe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s just it, senhor,” declared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>other; “he is a Harcliffe, and since his
father’s death, one of the great firm of
Harcliffe Brothers. It is absurd to think
one of his position would go to Brazil to
serve Miguel de Pintra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps the adventure entices him,”
returned de Guarde’s soft voice, in reflective
tones. “He is but lately from college, and
his uncle may wish him to know something
of Brazil, where the greater part of the
Harcliffe fortune has been made.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Deus Meo!</span></i>” exclaimed the Captain;
“but you seem to know everything about
everybody, my dear Valcour! However,
this suspicion of young Harcliffe is nonsense,
I assure you. You must look elsewhere
for the new secretary—provided, of course,
he is on my ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, he is doubtless on board,” answered
de Guarde, with a low, confident laugh.
“De Pintra’s letters asked that a man be
sent on the first ship bound for Rio, and
Nelson Harcliffe is known to act promptly
in all business matters. Moreover, I have
studied carefully the personality of each of
your passengers, and none of them seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>fitted for the post so perfectly as young Harcliffe
himself. I assure you, my dear Lertine,
that I am right. He can be going out for
no other purpose than to assist de Pintra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Captain whistled softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Therefore?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Therefore,” continued de Guarde,
gravely, “it is my duty to prevent his reaching
his destination.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will have him arrested when we
reach Rio?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arrested? No, indeed. Those Americans
at Washington become peevish if we
arrest one of their citizens, however criminal
he may be. The situation demands delicate
treatment, and my orders are positive.
Our new secretary for the revolution must
not reach Rio.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the Captain whistled—a vague
melody with many false and uncertain notes.
And the other remained silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naturally I found the conversation most
interesting, and no feeling of delicacy prevented
my straining my ears to catch more
of it. It was the Captain who broke the
long silence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Nevertheless, my dear Valcour—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“De Guarde, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nevertheless, de Guarde, our Mr. Harcliffe
may be innocent, and merely journeying
to Brazil on business.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I propose to satisfy myself on that
point. Great God, man! do you think I
love this kind of work—even for the Emperor’s
protection? But my master is just,
though forced at times to act with seeming
cruelty. I must be sure that Harcliffe is
going to Brazil as secretary to the rebel
leader, and you must aid me in determining
the fact. When our man goes to
breakfast in the morning I will examine his
room for papers. The pass-key is on the
bunch you gave me, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it is there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well. Join your passengers at
breakfast, and should Mr. Harcliffe leave
the table on any pretext, see that I am duly
warned.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly, senhor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And now I am going to bed. Good
night, Lertine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good night, de Guarde.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>They moved cautiously away, and a few
minutes later I followed, regaining my
state-room without encountering any one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once in my bunk I lay revolving the
situation in my mind. Evidently it was far
from safe to involve one’s self in Brazilian
politics. My friend Valcour, as the Captain
had called him, was a spy of the Emperor,
masquerading under the title of
Senhor Manuel Cortes de Guarde. A
clever fellow, indeed, despite his soft, feminine
ways and innocent chatter, and one
who regarded even murder as permissible
in the execution of his duty to Dom Pedro.
It was the first time in my life I had been,
to my knowledge, in any personal danger,
and the sensation was rather agreeable than
otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'>It astonished me to discover that de
Guarde knew so perfectly the contents of
Dom Miguel’s letter to my uncle. Doubtless
the secret police had read and made a
copy of it before the blue envelope had
been permitted to leave Brazil. But in that
case, I could not understand why they had
allowed the missive to reach its destination.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>In his cool analysis of the situation, my
friend the spy had unerringly hit upon the
right person as the prospective secretary of
the revolutionary leader. Yet he had no
positive proof, and it was pleasant to reflect
that in my possession were no papers of any
sort that might implicate me. Uncle Nelson
had even omitted the customary letter of
introduction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“De Pintra knew your father, and your
face will therefore vouch for your identity,”
the old gentleman had declared. Others
have remarked upon the strong resemblance
I bear my father, and I had no doubt de
Pintra would recognize me. But, in addition,
I had stored in my memory a secret
word that would serve as talisman in case
of need.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chances of my puzzling Dom Pedro’s
detective were distinctly in my favor, and I
was about to rest content in that knowledge,
when an idea took possession of me that
promised so much amusement that I could
not resist undertaking it. It may be that
I was influenced by a mild chagrin at the
deception practised upon me by de Guarde,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>or the repulsion that a secret-service man
always inspires in the breast of a civilian.
Anyway, I resolved to pit my wits against
those of Senhor Valcour, and having formulated
my plan I fell asleep and rested comfortably
until daybreak.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been my habit to carry with me
a pocket diary, inscribing therein any vivid
impressions or important events that occurred
to me. There were many blank
pages, for my life had been rather barren
of incident of late; but I had resolved to
keep a record of this trip and for this purpose
the little book was now lying upon
the low shelf that served as table in my
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arising somewhat before my usual hour
I made a hurried toilet and sat down to
make entries in my diary. I stated that
my sudden desire to visit Brazil was due to
curiosity, and that my uncle had placed
several minor business matters in my hands
to attend to. My return to New Orleans
would depend entirely upon how well I
liked the country where our house had
so successfully traded for a half-century.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Arriving at this point, I added the following
paragraphs:</p>

<p class='c010'>“On the ship with me Uncle Nelson is sending a private
secretary to Dom Miguel de Pintra, who, it seems, was an
ancient customer of our house, but is now more interested
in politics than in commerce. This secretary is a remarkable
fellow, yet so placid and unassuming that no one is
likely to suspect his mission. He seems to know everything,
and has astonished me by his intimate knowledge
of all that transpires upon the ship. For example, he tells
me that my friend de Guarde, of whom I have already
grown fond, is none other than a certain Valcour, well
known in the secret service of his majesty the Emperor of
Brazil. Valcour is on board because he knows the contents
of a letter written by de Pintra to my uncle, asking
for a shrewd American to become his private secretary;
also Valcour is instructed to dispose of the rebel secretary
before we land at Rio—meaning, of course, to murder
him secretly. This seemingly horrible plot but amuses
our secretary, for Valcour has only poor Captain Lertine
to aid him, whereas the wonderful American has a following
of desperate men trained to deeds of bloodshed who
will obey his slightest nod. From what I learn I am
confident the plan is to assassinate my friend Valcour
in a secret manner, for here is a rare opportunity to rid
themselves of a hated royalist spy. Poor de Guarde!
I would like to warn him of his danger, but dare not.
Even then, I doubt his ability to escape. The toils are
closing about him, even while he innocently imagines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that he, as the Emperor’s agent, controls the situation.
It would all be laughable, were it not so very terrible in
its tragic aspect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there! I must not mix with politics, but strive
to hold aloof from either side. The secretary, though
doubtless a marvel of diplomacy and duplicity, is too
unscrupulous to suit me. He has actually corrupted
the entire crew, from the engineers down, and at his word
I am assured the fellows would mutiny and seize the ship.
What chance has my poor friend de Guarde—or Valcour—to
escape this demon? Yet, after all, it is not my affair,
and I dare not speak.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This entry I intended to puzzle Senhor
Valcour, even if it failed to wholly deceive
him. I wrote it with assumed carelessness,
to render it uniform with the former paragraphs
the book contained. These last
were of a trivial nature, dating back for
some months. They would interest no one
but myself; yet I expected them to be
read, for I left the diary lying upon my
shelf, having first made a number of pin-marks
in the paint, at the edges of the
cover, so that I might assure myself, on
my return to the room, whether or not the
book had been disturbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This task completed, I locked the door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>behind me and cheerfully joined the breakfast
party in the main cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Guarde was not present, but no one
seemed to miss him, and we lingered long
in light conversation over the meal, as it is
the custom of passengers aboard a slow-going
ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterward, when I went on deck, I discovered
de Guarde leaning over the rail,
evidently in deep thought. As I strolled
past him, puffing my cigar, he turned
around, and the sight of his face, white and
stern, positively startled me. The soft dark
eyes had lost their confident, merry look,
and bore a trace of fear. No need to
examine the pin-marks on my shelf. The
Emperor’s spy had, without doubt, read
the false entry in my diary, and it had impressed
him beyond my expectation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>A GOOD REPUBLICAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During the remainder of the voyage I
had little intercourse with Senhor Manuel
Cortes de Guarde. Indeed, I had turned
the tables quite cleverly upon the spy, who
doubtless imagined many dangers in addition
to those indicated in my diary. For
my part, I became a bit ashamed of the
imposition I had practised, despite the
fact that the handsome young Brazilian
had exhibited a perfect willingness to
assassinate me in the Emperor’s interests.
Attracted toward him in spite of my discoveries,
I made<a id='t29'></a> several attempts to resume
our former friendly intercourse; but he
recoiled from my overtures and shunned
my society.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to impress upon de Guarde the
truth of the assertions I had made in the
diary I selected a young physician, a Dr.
Neel, to impersonate the intriguing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>bloodthirsty American secretary. He was
a quiet, unobtrusive fellow, with an intelligent
face, and a keen, inquiring look in
his eyes. I took occasion to confide to
Dr. Neel, in a mysterious manner that must
have amused him, that I was afflicted with
an incomprehensible disease. He promptly
mistook me for a hypochondriac, and
humored me in a good-natured fashion, so
that we were frequently observed by de
Guarde in earnest and confidential conversation.
My ruse proved effective. Often
I surprised a look of anxiety upon the
Brazilian’s face as he watched Dr. Neel
from a distance; but de Guarde took
pains not to mingle with any group that the
physician made part of, and it was evident
the detective had no longer any desire to precipitate
a conflict during the voyage to Rio.</p>

<p class='c000'>I do not say that Valcour was cowardly.
In his position I am positive I could not
have escaped the doubts that so evidently
oppressed him. He secluded himself in his
state-room, under pretense of illness, as we
drew nearer to Brazil, and I was considerably
relieved to have him out of the way.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Captain Lertine, to whom Valcour had
evidently confided his discovery of the
diary, was also uneasy during those days,
and took occasion to ask me many questions
about Dr. Neel, which I parried in a way
that tended to convince him that the physician
was none other than the secret emissary
sent by my uncle to Miguel de Pintra. The
good Captain was nervous over the safety
of the ship, telling me in a confidential way
that nearly all his crew were new hands,
and that he had no confidence in their
loyalty to the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face bore an expression of great
relief when we anchored in the bay of Rio
de Janiero on a clear June morning at daybreak,
and no time was lost in transferring
the passengers of the Castina to a small
steam launch, which soon landed us and
our effects upon the quay.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had not seen Valcour since we anchored,
but after bidding good by to Dr. Neel,
who drove directly to his hotel, I caught a
glimpse of the detective’s eager face as he
followed the doctor in a cab.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole affair struck me as being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>huge joke, and the sensation of danger
that I experienced on board the ship was
dissolved by the bright sunshine and the
sight of the great city calmly awakening
and preparing for its usual daily round of
business.</p>

<p class='c000'>I dispatched my trunks to the Continental
Railway station, and finding that I
had ample time determined to follow them
on foot, the long walk being decidedly
grateful after the days on shipboard. Much
as I longed to see the beauties of Brazil’s
famous capital, I dared not at this time
delay to do so, as my uncle had impressed
upon me the necessity of presenting myself
to de Pintra as soon as possible after my
arrival.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another thing that influenced me was
the deception that I had practised upon
the detective. Valcour, with the Emperor
at his back, was now a power to be reckoned
with, and as soon as he discovered that I
had misled him the police would doubtless
be hot upon my trail. So my safest plan
was to proceed at once to the province where
my new chief had power to protect me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I reached the railway station without
difficulty and found I had a quarter of an
hour to spare.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me a ticket to Cuyaba,” I said
to the clerk at the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stared at me as he handed the card
through the grating.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Matto Grosso train, senhor,” he said.
“It leaves at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” I returned, moving away.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tall policeman in an odd uniform of
black and gold barred my way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your pardon, senhor Americano,” said
he, touching his visor in salute; “I beg
you to follow me quietly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned on his heel and marched
away, and I, realizing that trouble had
already overtaken me, followed him to the
street.</p>

<p class='c000'>A patrol was drawn up at the curb, a
quaint-looking vehicle set low between four
high wheels and covered with canvas.
Startled at the sight I half turned, with a
vague idea of escape, and confronted two
stout policemen at my rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Resistance seemed useless. I entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the wagon, my captor seating himself upon
the bench beside me. Instantly we whirled
away at a rapid pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now discerned two men, also in uniform,
upon the front seat. One was driving
the horses, and presently the other climbed
over the seat and sat opposite my guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tall policeman frowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you here, Marco?” he demanded,
in a threatening voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For this!” was the prompt answer;
and with the words I caught a quick flash
as the man called Marco buried a knife
to the hilt in the other’s breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>My captor scarce uttered a sound as he
pitched headforemost upon the floor of the
now flying wagon. The driver had but
given a glance over his shoulder and lashed
his horses to their utmost speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cold with horror at the revolting deed
I gazed into the dark eyes of the murderer.
He smiled as he answered my look and
shrugged his shoulders as if excusing the
crime.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A blow for freedom, senhor!” he
announced, in his soft, native patois.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Dom Miguel would be grieved were you
captured by the police.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I started.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dom Miguel! You know him, then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Assuredly, senhor. You are the new
secretary. Otherwise you would not be so
foolish as to demand a ticket to Cuyaba—the
seat of the revolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I begin to understand,” I said, after
a moment’s thought. “You are of the
police?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sergeant Marco, senhor; at your service.
And I have ventured to kill our dear
lieutenant in order to insure your safety.
I am sorry,” he added, gently touching the
motionless form that lay between us; “the
lieutenant was a good comrade—but a persistent
royalist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you taking me?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To a suburban crossing, where you
may catch the Matto Grosso train.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I? I am in no danger, senhor. It
is you who have done this cruel deed—and
you will escape. The driver—a true patriot—will
join me in accusing you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>I nodded, my horror of the tragedy
growing each moment. Truly this revolutionary
party must be formed of desperate
and unscrupulous men, who hesitated at
no crime to advance their interests. If
the royalists were but half so cruel I had
indeed ventured into a nest of adders. And
it was the thought of Valcour’s confessed
purpose to murder me on shipboard that
now sealed my lips from a protest against
this deed that was to be laid upon my
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently the wagon slowed up, stopping
with a jerk that nearly threw me from my
seat. The sergeant alighted and assisted
me to follow him.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were at a deserted crossing, and the
buildings of the city lay scattered a quarter
of a mile away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take this flag, senhor. The engineer
will stop to let you aboard. Farewell, and
kindly convey my dutiful respects to Dom
Miguel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As the wagon rolled away the train came
gliding from the town, and I stepped between
the tracks and waved the flag as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>directed. The engine slowed down, stopped
a brief instant, and I scrambled aboard as
the train recovered speed and moved swiftly
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the present, at least, I was safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quite unobtrusively I seated myself in
the rear end of the passenger coach and
gazed from the window as we rushed along,
vainly endeavoring to still the nervous
beating of my heart and to collect and center
my thoughts upon the trying situation
in which I found myself. Until the last
hour I had been charmed with my mission
to Brazil, imagining much pleasure in acting
as secretary to a great political leader
engaged in a struggle for the freedom of his
country. The suggestion of danger my
post involved had not frightened me, nor
did it even now; but I shrank from the
knowledge that cold-blooded assassination
was apparently of little moment to these
conspirators. In less than two hours after
landing at Rio I found myself fleeing from
the police, with a foul and revolting murder
fastened upon me in the name of the revolution!
Where would it all end? Did Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Nelson thoroughly realize the terrible nature
of the political plot into which he had so
calmly thrust me? Probably not. But
already I knew that Brazil was a dangerous
country and sheltered a hot-headed and
violent people.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long and dreary ride as we
mounted the grade leading to the tablelands
of the interior. Yet the country was
beautifully green and peaceful under the
steady glare of the sun, and gradually my
distress passed away and left me more
composed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither the passengers nor trainmen
paid the slightest attention to me, and
although at first I looked for arrest at every
station where we halted, there was no
indication that the police of Rio had discovered
my escape and flight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Night came at last, and I dozed fitfully
during the long hours, although still too
nervous for sound sleep. We breakfasted
at a way-station, and a couple of hours
later, as I was gazing thoughtfully out the
window, the conductor aroused me by
settling into the seat at my side. He was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>short, pudgy individual, and wheezed
asthmatically with every breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I received a telegram at the last station,”
he confided to me, choking and
coughing between the words. “It instructed
me to arrest an American senhor traveling
to Cuyaba. Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I shivered, and stared back into his
dull eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! I thought not,” he continued,
with a short laugh. “It is not the first
telegram they have sent this trip from Rio,
you know; but I cannot find the fellow anywhere
aboard. Do you wonder? How can
I be expected to distinguish an American
from a Brazilian? Bah! I am not of the
police.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I began to breathe again. The conductor
nudged my ribs with his elbow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These police will perhaps be at the
station. Cuyaba is the next stop. But we
will slow up, presently, at a curve near the
edge of the forest. Were I the American,
and aboard this train, I would get out there,
and wait among the trees in the forest until
Dom Miguel’s red cart comes along. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ai de mim</span></i>, the American is not here! Eh?
Thank God for it! But I must leave,
senhor. Good day to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He bustled away, and at once I seized
my traveling-bag and slipped out to the
back platform. We slowed up at the curve
a moment later, and I sprang to the ground
and entered the shade of a group of trees
that marked the edge of the little forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there I sat upon a fallen tree-trunk
for two weary hours, wondering what
would happen next, and wishing with all
my heart I had never ventured into this
intrigue-ridden country. But at the end
of that time I heard the rattle of a wagon
and the regular beat of a horse’s feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peering from my refuge I discerned a
red cart slowly approaching over the road
that wound between the railway track and
the forest. It was driven by a sleepy
Brazilian boy in a loose white blouse and a
wide straw hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he arrived opposite me I stepped out
and hailed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you from Dom Miguel de Pintra?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am the American he is expecting,”
I continued, and climbed to the seat beside
him. He showed no surprise at my action,
nor, indeed, any great interest in the
meeting; but as soon as I was seated he
whipped up the horse, which developed
unexpected speed, and we were soon rolling
swiftly over the country road.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE CHIEFTAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The province of Matto Grosso is very
beautiful, the residences reminding one
greatly of English country estates, except
that their architecture is on the stiff Portuguese
order. At least a half-mile separated
the scattered mansions from one
another, and the grounds were artistically
planned and seemingly well cared for.
At this season the rich, luxuriant foliage of
Brazil was at its best, and above all brooded
a charming air of peace that was extremely
comforting after my late exciting experiences.
We met few people on the way,
and these were peasants, who touched their
hats respectfully as we passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had driven some five miles when we
came to an estate rather more extensive
than its neighbors, for the hedge of blooming
cactus that divided the grounds from
the roadway ran in an unbroken line as far
as the eye could reach.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>However, we came to a gateway at last
and turned into the grounds, where magnificent
trees shaded a winding drive ascending
to the fine old mansion of de Pintra.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man stood upon the porch shading his
eyes with his hand and gazing at us as we
approached. When I alighted from the
cart he came down the steps to meet me,
bowing very courteously, and giving my
hand a friendly pressure. No other person
was in sight, and the red cart had disappeared
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are welcome, sir,” he said, in a
quiet but most agreeable voice. “You
come from my friend Nelson Harcliffe?
That was my thought.” He paused to
give me a keen look, and then smiled—a
sweet, winning smile such as I have seldom
seen. “Ah! may you not be a Harcliffe
yourself? Your features seem quite familiar.
But, pardon me, sir; I have not introduced
myself. I am Miguel de Pintra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I fear I stared at him with somewhat
rude intentness, for Dom Miguel was a
man to arouse interest in any beholder.
Tall, spare, but not ungraceful, his snow-white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hair and beard made strong contrast
with his bronzed features. His eyes, soft
and gentle in expression, were black. His
smile, which was not frequent, disclosed a
line of even, white teeth. His dress was a
suit of plain, well-fitting black, supplemented
by irreproachable linen. Taken
altogether, Dom Miguel appeared a model
of the old school of gentility, which may be
as quickly recognized in Brazil as in England,
France or America. Indeed, it seemed
an absurdity to connect this eminently
respectable personage with revolutions, murders,
and intrigue, and my spirits rose the
moment I set eyes upon his pleasant face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Robert Harcliffe,” said I, answering
the question his politeness would
not permit him to ask; “the son of Marshall
Harcliffe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A flash of surprise and delight swept over
his dark face. He seized both my hands
in his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” he cried, “Nelson Harcliffe
has sent me his own nephew, the son of
my dear old friend? This is, indeed, a
rare expression of loyalty!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“I thought you knew,” I rejoined,
rather embarrassed, for the fathomless eyes
were reading me with singular eagerness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I only knew that Nelson Harcliffe
would respond promptly to my requests.
I knew that the Castina would bring my
secretary to Brazil. But whom he might
be I could not even guess.” He paused a
moment, to continue in a graver tone: “I
am greatly pleased. I need a friend—a
faithful assistant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope I may prove to be both, sir,”
I returned, earnestly. “But you seem not
to lack loyal friends. On my way hither
from Rio de Janiero I have been protected
more than once, doubtless by your
orders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; the cause has many true adherents,
and I notified our people to expect an
American gentleman on the Castina and
to forward him to me in safety. They
know, therefore, that you came to assist the
Revolution, and it would have been strange,
indeed, had the royalists been able to
interfere with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your party is more powerful than I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>had suspected,” I remarked, thinking of
my several narrow escapes from arrest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are only powerful because the
enemy is weak,” answered Dom Miguel,
with a sigh. “Neither side is ready for
combat, or even an open rupture. It is now
the time of intrigue, of plot and counterplot,
of petty conspiracies and deceits. These
would discourage any honest heart were not
the great Cause behind it all—were not the
struggle for freedom and our native land!
But come; you are weary. Let me show
you to your room, Robert Harcliffe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He dwelt upon the name with seeming
tenderness, and I began to understand why
my father and my stern Uncle Nelson had
both learned to love this kindly natured
gentleman of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c000'>He led me through cool and spacious
passages to a cozy room on the ground floor,
which, he told me, connected by a door
with his study or work-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear my trunks have been seized by
the government,” said I, and then related
to him the details of my arrest and the
assassination of the police lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>He listened to the story calmly and without
interruption; but when it was finished
he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“All will be reported to me this evening,
and then we will see whether your baggage
cannot be saved. There were no papers
that might incriminate you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None whatever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I gave him the story of Valcour,
or de Guarde, and he smiled when I
related the manner in which the fellow had
been deceived.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew that Valcour had been dispatched
to intercept my secretary,” said
he, “and you must know that this personage
is not an ordinary spy, but attached
to the Emperor himself as a special detective.
Hereafter,” he continued, reflectively,
“the man will be your bitter enemy; and
although you have outwitted him once he
is a foe not to be despised. Indeed,
Harcliffe, your post is not one of much
security. If, when I have taken you fully
into our confidence, you decide to link your
fortunes to those of the Revolution, it will
be with the full knowledge that your life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>may be the forfeit. But there—we will
speak no more of business until after dinner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He left me, then, with many cordial
expressions of friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>A servant brought my luncheon on a
tray, and after eating it I started for a
stroll through the grounds, enjoying the
fragrance and brilliance of the flowers, the
beauties of the shrubbery, and the stately
rows of ancient trees. The quiet of the
place suggested nothing of wars and revolutions,
and it was with real astonishment
that I reflected that this establishment was
the central point of that conspiracy whose
far-reaching power had been so vividly
impressed upon me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Engaged in this thought I turned the
corner of a hedge and came face to face
with a young girl, who recoiled in surprise
and met my gaze with a sweet embarrassment
that caused me to drop my own eyes
in confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your pardon, senhorita!” I exclaimed,
and stood aside for her to pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>She nodded, still searching my face with
her clear eyes, but making no movement to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>proceed. I noted the waves of color sweeping
over her fair face and the nervous tension
of the little hands that pressed a mass
of flowers to her bosom. Evidently she
was struggling for courage to address me;
so I smiled at her, reassuringly, and again
bowed in my best manner, for I was not
ill pleased at the encounter.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have always had a profound reverence
for woman—especially those favored
ones to whom Nature has vouchsafed
beauty in addition to the charm of
womanhood. And here before me stood
the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, a
type of loveliness more sweet and delightful
than any I had even dreamed could exist.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was my fate to recognize this in the
moments that I stood watching her lips
tremble in the endeavor to form her first
words to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are the American?” she asked,
finally.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Assuredly, donzella. Permit me to
introduce myself. I am Robert Harcliffe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My uncle expected you,” she said,
shyly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Your uncle?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dom Miguel is not really my uncle,”
answered the girl; “but he permits me to
call him so, since he is my guardian. Yet
it was not from him I learned of your
arrival, but from Francisco, who traveled
from Rio on the same train.”</p>

<p class='c000'>My face doubtless showed that I was
puzzled, for she added, quickly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Francisco is my brother, senhor. We
are both devoted heart and soul to the
Cause. That is why I felt that I must
speak with you, why I must welcome you
to our fellowship, why I must implore you
to be strong and steadfast in our behalf!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I smiled at the vehemence that had
vanquished her former hesitation, and to
my delight her exquisite face lighted with
an answering smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, you may laugh at me with impunity,
senhor Americano, for I have
intuitions, and they tell me you will be
faithful to the cause of freedom. Nay, do
not protest. It is enough that I have read
your face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this she made a pretty courtesy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and vanished around the hedge before I
could summon a word to detain her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is astonishing to what an extent this
encounter aroused my enthusiasm for “the
Cause.” Heretofore I had regarded it
rather impersonally, as an affair in which
I had engaged at the request of my good
uncle. But now that I had met this fellow-conspirator
and gazed into the enchanting
depths of her eyes, I was tremendously eager
to prove my devotion to the cause of
freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>True, I had seen the girl but a few
moments. Even her name was unknown
to me. But she was a rebel; Francisco,
her brother, was a rebel; and Dom Miguel
permitted her to call him “uncle.” Very
good; very good, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'>When I returned to my room I was
surprised to find my trunks there, they
having arrived in some mysterious way
during my brief absence.</p>

<p class='c000'>I dressed for dinner and found my way
to the drawing-room, where my host—or
my employer, rather—was conversing with
a lady and a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>There was no reason my heart should
give that bound to warn me; no one could
fail to recognize that slender, graceful
figure, although it was now enveloped in
dainty folds of soft white <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">mulle</span>. But she
had no intention of allowing her chance
meeting to stand for a formal introduction,
and as Dom Miguel presented me she shot
a demure yet merry glance at me from
beneath her long lashes that might readily
have effected my conquest had I not already
surrendered without discretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Senhorita Lesba Paola,” announced
de Pintra, speaking the name with
evident tenderness. Then he turned to the
man. “Senhor Francisco Paola,” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>Francisco Paola puzzled me at that first
meeting nearly as much as he did later.
His thin form was dressed in a dandified
manner that was almost ludicrous, and the
fellow’s affectation was something amazing.
Somewhat older than his bewitching sister,
his features were not without a sort of
effeminate beauty, of which he seemed
fully aware. At once I conceived him to
be a mere popinjay, and had no doubt he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>would prove brainless and well-nigh insufferable.
But Dom Miguel introduced
Paola with grave courtesy and showed him
so much deference that I could not well be
ungracious to the young dandy. Moreover,
he had a stronger claim to my toleration:
he was Lesba’s brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely were these introductions complete
when another lady entered the room.
She gave a slight start at sight of me, and
then advanced gracefully to Dom Miguel’s
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My daughter, Mr. Harcliffe; Senhora
Izabel de Mar,” said he, and gave me a
curious glance that I could not understand.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked at Madam Izabel and lowered
my eyes before the cold and penetrating
stare I encountered. She was handsome
enough, this woman; but her features, however
regular, were repellant because of their
absolute lack of expression—a lack caused
by repression more than a want of mobility.
Her face seemed carved of old ivory. Even
the great eyes were impenetrable, reflecting
nothing of the emotions that might dwell
within. I found myself shivering, and
although I sincerely tried to be agreeable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Dom Miguel’s daughter, the result was
little more than farcical.</p>

<p class='c000'>My sudden appearance in the household
had evidently caused Madam Izabel surprise;
perhaps it annoyed her, as well. But
she drew me to a seat beside her and plied
me with questions which I was at a loss how
to answer, in view of the supposedly private
nature of my mission to Brazil. Inwardly
I blamed Dom Miguel for not telling me
how far his daughter and his guests were in
his confidence; but before I blundered more
than a few aimless sentences a light voice
interrupted us and Francisco Paola leaned
over Madam Izabel’s chair with a vapid
compliment on the lady’s charms and personal
appearance that was fairly impertinent
in its flippancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The look she gave him would have silenced
an ordinary man; but Senhor Francisco
smiled at her frown, took the fan from
her hand, and wielded it in a mincing manner,
pouring into her unwilling ears a
flood of nonsense that effectually cut me
out of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel came to my relief by requesting
me to take the younger lady in to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>dinner, and to my surprise Madam Izabel
took Paola’s arm without apparent reluctance
and followed us to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The repast would have been, I fear,
rather stupid, but for Senhor Francisco’s
ceaseless chatter. To my great disappointment
the donzella Lesba Paola appeared
exceedingly shy, and I could scarce recognize
in her my eager questioner of the
afternoon. De Pintra, indeed, courteously
endeavored to draw the ladies into a
general conversation; but his daughter was
cold and unresponsive, and the host himself
appeared to be in a thoughtful mood.
For my part, I was glad to have the fop
monopolize the conversation, while I devoted
my attention to the silent girl beside
me; but it was evident that a general
feeling of relief prevailed when the ladies
returned to the drawing-room and left us
to our cigars and wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the servants had been dismissed
and we three men were alone, Dom Miguel
addressed me with unrestrained frankness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose you know little of our revolutionary
movement, Mr. Harcliffe,” he began.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Very little, indeed,” I responded, briefly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It dates back for several years, but has
only recently attained to real importance.
Gradually our people, of all degrees, have
awakened to the knowledge that they must
resist the tyranny of the imperial government,
with its horde of selfish and unscrupulous
retainers. The Emperor is honest
enough, but weak, and his advisors leave
him no exercise of his own royal will.
Spurred by the nation’s distress, the Revolution
has at last taken definite form, and at
present centers in me. But as our strength
grows our danger increases. The existing
government, knowing itself threatened, has
become keen to ferret out our secrets and to
discover the leaders of the Cause, that they
may crush all with one blow.” He paused,
and flicked the ash from his cigar with a
thoughtful gesture. “For this, and many
another reason, I need the assistance of a
secretary whom I may trust implicitly—who
will, if need be, die rather than betray my
confidence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I glanced hesitatingly at the man opposite
me. It seemed strange that Dom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Miguel should speak of these personal matters
before a third party.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola was trying to balance a spoon upon
the edge of his glass. He met my gaze with
the usual vacant smile upon his face, yet
in the instant I caught a gleam in his eye so
shrewd and comprehensive that it positively
startled me. Instantly his face was shrouded
in a cloud of smoke from his cigar, and
when it cleared away the idiotic leer that
appeared upon his countenance indicated
anything rather than intelligence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel looked from one to the other
of us and smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps I should tell you,” said he,
earnestly, “that no man is higher in our
counsels or more thoroughly esteemed by
all classes of patriots than Francisco Paola.
You may speak in his presence with entire
freedom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this the popinjay twisted the end of
his moustache and bowed with mock dignity.
I stared at him with an astonishment
tinged with disgust. His eyes were now
glassy and his gaze vacuous. The eternal
smile expressed merely stupidity and conceit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>I turned to Dom Miguel, who gravely
awaited my reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir,” said I, “you are my father’s old
friend. My uncle, who was my father’s
partner and is now my own associate in
business, sent me to you with the injunction
to serve you to the best of my ability. This,
by way of gratitude for many favors shown
our house by you in the days when a friend
counted largely for success. Being an American,
I love freedom. Your cause shall be
my cause while I remain with you. Of my
power to serve you there may be question;
but my loyalty you need never doubt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel reached across the table
and grasped my hand warmly. Paola
poured himself a glass of wine and drank
to me with a nod of his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When first I saw you,” said de Pintra,
with emotion, “I knew we had gained a
strong ally, and God knows we need trustworthy
friends at this juncture. The great
Revolution, which is destined some day to
sweep Brazil from Para to Rio Grande do
Sul, is now in my keeping. In my possession
are papers wherein are inscribed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>names of the patriots who have joined our
Cause; to me has been intrusted the treasure
accumulated for years to enable us to carry
out our plans. Even those plans—carefully
formulated and known to but a few of my
associates, the trusted leaders—are confided
to my care. I cannot risk a betrayal that
would imperil the Revolution itself and
destroy all those concerned in it, by employing
for secretary a Brazilian, who might
become a spy of Dom Pedro, or be frightened
by threats and imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaning forward, he regarded me earnestly.
His eyes, so gentle in repose, now
searched my own with fierce intensity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot even trust my own household,”
he whispered; “my own flesh and blood has
been suspected of treason to the Cause.
There are spies everywhere, of both sexes,
among the lowly and the gentle. So I accept
your services, Robert Harcliffe, and
thank you in the name of the Revolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all rather theatric, but I could not
question the sincerity of his speech, and it
succeeding in impressing me with the gravity
of my new position.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Come,” said Paola, breaking the tense
pause, “let us rejoin the ladies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Five minutes later he was at the piano,
carolling a comic ditty, and I again wondered
what element this seemingly brazen
and hollow vessel might contain that could
win the respect of a man like Miguel de
Pintra. Evidently I must, to some extent,
glean a definite knowledge of the Revolution
and its advocates through a process of absorption.
This would require time, as well
as personal contact with Dom Miguel and
his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</span>, and my only hope of mastering
the situation lay in a careful study of each
personage I met and a cautious resistance
of any temptation to judge them hastily.
Nevertheless, this mocking, irrepressive
Francisco Paola had from the first moment
of his acquaintance become an astounding
puzzle to me, and so far I could see no indication
of any depths to his character that
could explain the esteem in which he was
held by the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now his sister’s sweet, upturned face
drew me to her side, and I straightway forgot
to dwell upon the problem.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>MADAM IZABEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I slept well in my pleasant room, but
wakened early, the bright sunshine pouring
in at my open window and the songs of many
birds sounding a lively chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a simple toilet I sprang through a
low window to the ground and wandered
away among the flowers and shrubbery. It
was in my thoughts to revisit the scene of
my first meeting with Lesba, but I had no
hope of finding her abroad at that hour until
I caught a glimpse of her white gown through
a small arbor. The vision enchanted me,
and after pausing a moment to feast my eyes
upon her loveliness, I hastily approached
to find her cutting roses for the breakfast-table.
She greeted me in her shy manner,
but in a way that made me feel I was not intruding.
After a few conventional remarks
she asked, abruptly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you like Dom Miguel?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Very much,” said I, smiling at her
eagerness. “He seems eminently worthy
of the confidence reposed in him by his compatriots.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is a born leader of men,” she rejoined,
brightly, “and not a rebel of us all
would hesitate to die for him. How do you
like my brother?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was sorry she asked the question, for
its abruptness nearly took my breath away,
and I did not wish to grieve her. To gain
time I laughed, and was answered with a
frown that served to warn me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Really, donzella,” I made haste to say,
“if I must be quite frank, your brother puzzles
me. But I think I shall like him when
I understand him better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She shook her head as if disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No one ever understands Francisco
but me,” she returned, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does he understand himself?” I foolishly
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl looked at me with a gleam of
contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir, my brother’s services are recognized
throughout all Brazil. Even Fonseca respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>his talents, and the suspicious Piexoto
trusts him implicitly. Francisco’s intimate
friends positively adore him! Ah, senhor,
it is not necessary for his sister to sing his
praises.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I bowed gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me hope, donzella, that your
brother will soon count me among his intimates.”
It was the least I could say in
answer to the pleading look in her eyes, and
to my surprise it seemed to satisfy her, for
she blushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure he likes you already,” she
announced; “for he told me so as he bade
me good by this morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your brother has gone away?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He started upon his return to court an
hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To court!” I exclaimed, amazed at his
audacity.</p>

<p class='c000'>She seemed amused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you not know, senhor? Francisco
Paola is Dom Pedro’s Minister of Police.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I acknowledged that the news surprised
me. That the Emperor’s Minister of Police
should be a trusted leader of the Revolutionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>party seemed incomprehensible; but
I had already begun to realize that extraordinary
conditions prevailed in Brazil.
Perhaps the thing that caused me most
astonishment was that this apparently conceited
and empty-headed fellow had ever
been selected for a post so important as Minister
of Police. Yet the fact explained
clearly how I had received secret protection
from the moment of my landing at Rio until
I had joined Dom Miguel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl was laughing at me now, and
her loveliness made me resolve not to waste
more of these precious moments in political
discussion. She was nothing loath to drop
the subject, and soon we were chattering
merrily of the flowers and birds, the dewdrops
and the sunshine, and all those inconsequent
things that are wont to occupy
youthful lips while hearts beat fast and
glances shyly mingle. When, at length, we
sauntered up the path to breakfast I had forgotten
the great conspiracy altogether, and
congratulated myself cordially upon the fact
that Lesba and I were well on the way to
becoming good friends.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Madam Izabel did not appear at the
morning meal, and immediately it was over
Dom Miguel carried me to his study, where
he began to acquaint me thoroughly with
the standing and progress of the proposed
revolution, informing me, meantime, of my
duties as secretary.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we were thus occupied the door
softly opened and Izabel de Mar entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>She cast an odd glance in my direction,
bowed coldly to her father, and then seated
herself at a small table littered with papers.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cloud appeared upon Dom Miguel’s
brow. He hesitated an instant, and then
addressed her in a formal tone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall not need you to-day, Izabel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned upon him with a fierce gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The letters to Piexoto are not finished,
sir,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know, Izabel; I know. But Mr.
Harcliffe will act as my secretary, hereafter;
therefore he will attend to these details.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She rose to her feet, her eyes flashing,
but her face as immobile as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am discharged?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not that, Izabel,” he hastened to reply.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Your services have been of inestimable
value to the Cause. But they are wearing
out your strength, and some of our friends
thought you were too closely confined and
needed rest. Moreover, a man, they considered—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enough!” said she, proudly. “To me
it is a pleasure to toil in the cause of freedom.
But my services, it seems, are not
agreeable to your leaders—rather, let us say,
to that sly and treacherous spy, Francisco
Paola!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His face grew red, and I imagined he was
about to reply angrily; but the woman silenced
him with a wave of her hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“O, I know your confidence in the Emperor’s
Minister, my father; a confidence
that will lead you all to the hangman, unless
you beware! But why should I speak? I
am not trusted, it seems; I, the daughter of
de Pintra, who is chief of the Revolution.
This foreigner, whose heart is cold in our
Cause, is to take my place. Very well. I
will return to the court—to my husband.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Izabel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not fear. I will not betray you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>If betrayal comes, look to your buffoon,
the Minister of Police; look to your cold
American!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She pointed at me with so scornful a
gesture that involuntarily I recoiled, for the
attack was unexpected. Then my lady
stalked from the room like a veritable queen
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel drew a sigh of relief as the
door closed, and rubbed his forehead vigorously
with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That ordeal is at last over,” he muttered;
“and I have dreaded it like a coward.
Listen, senhor! My daughter, whose patriotism
is not well understood, has been
suspected by some of my associates. She
has a history, has Izabel—a sad history, my
friend.” For a moment Dom Miguel bowed
his face in his hands, and when he raised his
head again the look of pained emotion upon
his features lent his swarthy skin a grayish
tinge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Years ago she loved a handsome young
fellow, one Leon de Mar—of French descent,
who is even now a favorite with
the Emperor,” he resumed. “Against my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>wishes she married him, and her life at the
court proved a most unhappy one. De Mar
is a profligate, a rake, a gamester, and a
scoundrel. He made my daughter suffer
all the agonies of hell. But she uttered no
complaint and I knew nothing of her sorrow.
At last, unable to bear longer the scorn and
abuse of her husband, Izabel came to me
and confessed the truth, asking me to give
her the shelter of a home. That was years
ago, senhor. I made her my secretary, and
found her eager to engage in our patriotic
conspiracy. It is my belief that she has
neither seen nor heard from de Mar since;
but others have suspected her. It is hard
indeed, Robert, not to be suspicious in this
whirlpool of intrigue wherein we are engulfed.
A few weeks ago Paola swore that
he found Izabel in our garden at midnight
engaged in secret conversation with that
very husband from whom she had fled. I
have no doubt he was deceived; but he reported
it to the Secret Council, which instructed
me to confide no further secrets to
my daughter, and to secure a new secretary
as soon as possible. Hence my application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to your uncle, and your timely arrival to
assist me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, while I sat thoughtfully considering
his words.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I beg that you will not wrong my
daughter with hasty suspicions,” he continued,
pleadingly. “I do not wish you to
confide our secrets to her, since I have myself
refrained from doing so, out of respect for
the wishes of my associates. But do not
misjudge Izabel, my friend. When the
time comes for action she will be found a true
and valuable adherent to the Cause. And
now, let us to work!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I found it by no means difficult to become
interested in the details of the plot to overthrow
the Emperor Dom Pedro and establish
a Brazilian Republic. It was amazing
how many great names were enrolled in the
Cause and how thoroughly the spirit of freedom
had corrupted the royal army, the
court, and even the Emperor’s trusted police.
And I learned, with all this, to develop both
admiration and respect for the man whose
calm judgment had so far directed the
mighty movement and systematized every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>branch of the gigantic conspiracy. Truly,
as my fair Lesba had said, Dom Miguel de
Pintra was “a born leader of men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Night after night there assembled at his
house groups of conspirators who arrived
secretly and departed without even the servants
having knowledge of their visit. During
the counsels every approach to the house
was thoroughly guarded to ward against
surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strong men were these republican leaders;
alert, bold, vigilant in serving the Cause
wherein they risked their lives and fortunes.
One by one I came to know and admire
them, and they spoke freely in my presence
and trusted me. Through my intercourse
with these champions of liberty, my horizon
began to broaden, thus better fitting me
for my duties.</p>

<p class='c000'>Francisco Paola, the Emperor’s Minister,
came frequently to the conferences of the
Secret Council. Always he seemed as simpering,
frivolous, and absurd as on the day
I first met him. To his silly jokes and inconsequent
chatter none paid the slightest
attention; but when a real problem arose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and they turned questioningly to Paola, he
would answer in a few lightly spoken words
that proved at once shrewd and convincing.
The others were wont to accept his decisions
with gravity and act upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have said that Paola impressed me as
being conceited. This might well be true
in regard to his personal appearance, his
social accomplishments—playing the piano
and guitar, singing, riding, and the like—but
I never heard him speak lightly of the Cause
or boast of his connection with it. Indeed,
he exhibited a queer mingling of folly and
astuteness. His friends appeared to consider
his flippancy and self-adulation as a
mask that effectually concealed his real
talents. Doubtless the Emperor had the
same idea when he made the fellow his
Minister of Police. But I, studying the
man with fervid interest, found it difficult
to decide whether the folly was a mask, or
whether Paola had two natures—the second
a sub-conscious intelligence upon which he
was able to draw in a crisis.</p>

<p class='c000'>He certainly took no pains to impress
any one favorably, and his closest friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>were, I discovered, frequently disgusted by
his actions.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the first my judgment of the man
had been influenced by his sister’s enthusiastic
championship. Lesba seemed fully
in her brother’s confidence, and although she
was not a recognized member of the conspiracy,
I found that she was thoroughly
conversant with every detail of our progress.
This information must certainly have come
from Francisco, and as I relied absolutely
upon Lesba’s truth and loyalty, her belief
in her brother impressed me to the extent
of discrediting Madam Izabel’s charge that
he was a traitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, Paola had acted villainously
in thrusting this same charge upon a
woman. What object, I wondered, could
he have in accusing Izabel to her own
father, in falsely swearing that he had seen
her in conversation with Leon de Mar—the
man from whose ill treatment she had
fled?</p>

<p class='c000'>Madam Izabel had not returned to the
court, as she had threatened in her indignant
anger. Perhaps she realized what it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>mean to place herself again within the power
of the husband she had learned to hate and
despise. She still remained an inmate of
her father’s mansion, cold and impassive as
ever. Dom Miguel treated her with rare
consideration on every occasion of their
meeting, seeking to reassure her as to his
perfect faith in her loyalty and his sorrow
that his associates had cast a slur upon her
character.</p>

<p class='c000'>To me the chief was invariably kind, and
his gentleness and stalwart manhood soon
won my esteem. I found myself working
for the good of the cause with as much ardor
as the most eager patriot of them all, but
my reward was enjoyed as much in Lesba’s
smiles as in the approbation of Dom Miguel.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the government was well aware of
our plot there was no question. Through
secret channels we learned that even the
midnight meetings of the Secret Council
were known to the Emperor. The identity
of the leaders had so far been preserved,
since they came masked and cloaked to the
rendezvous, but so many of the details of the
conspiracy had in some way leaked out that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>I marveled the Emperor’s heavy hand had
not descended upon us long ago. Of course
de Pintra was a marked man, but they dared
not arrest him until they had procured all
the information they desired, otherwise they
would defeat their own purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>One stormy night, as I sat alone with
Dom Miguel in his study, I mentioned my
surprise that in view of the government’s
information of our plot we were not summarily
arrested. It was not a council night,
and we had been engaged in writing letters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose they fear to precipitate trouble
between such powerful factions,” he
answered, somewhat wearily. “The head
of the conspiracy is indeed here, but its
branches penetrate to every province of the
country, and were an outbreak to occur
here the republicans of Brazil would rise as
one man. Dom Pedro, poor soul, does not
know where to look for loyal support. His
ministry is estranged, and he is not even sure
of his army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But should they discover who our leaders
are, and capture them, there would be
no one to lead the uprising,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“True,” assented the chief. “But it is
to guard against such a coup that our Council
is divided into three sections. Only one-third
of the leaders could be captured at any
one time. But I do not fear such an attempt,
as every movement at the capital is reported
to me at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose they were to strike you down,
sir. What then? Who would carry out
your plans? Where would be the guiding
hand?”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment he sat thoughtfully regarding
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope I shall be spared until I have
accomplished my task,” he said, at length.
“I know my danger is great; yet it is not
for myself I fear. Lest the Cause be lost
through premature exposure, I have taken
care to guard against that, should the emergency
arise. Light me that candle yonder,
Robert, and I will reveal to you one of our
most important secrets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He motioned toward the mantel, smiling
meantime at my expression of surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>I lighted the candle, as directed, and
turned toward him expectantly. He drew a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>rug from before the fireplace, and stooping
over, touched a button that released a spring
in the flooring.</p>

<p class='c000'>A square aperture appeared, through
which a man might descend, and peering
over his shoulder I saw a flight of stairs
reaching far downward.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Pintra turned and took the candle
from my hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Follow me,” he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE SECRET VAULT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The stairs led us beneath the foundations
of the house and terminated in a domed
chamber constructed of stone and about ten
feet in diameter.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the floor of this chamber was a trapdoor,
composed of many thicknesses of
steel, and so heavy that it could be raised
only by a stout iron windlass, the chain of
which was welded to a ring in the door’s
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel handed me the candle and
began turning the windlass. Gradually
but without noise the heavy door of metal
rose, and disclosed a still more massive surface
underneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>This second plate, of highly burnished
steel, was covered with many small indentations,
of irregular formation. It was
about three feet square and the curious indentations,
each one of which had evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>been formed with great care, were scattered
over every inch of the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put out the light,” said de Pintra.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed, leaving us in total darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next moment, as I listened intently, I
heard a slight grating noise, followed by a
soft shooting of many bolts. Then a match
flickered, and Dom Miguel held it to the
wick and relighted the candle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second door had swung upward upon
hinges, showing three iron steps that led into
a vault below.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief descended and I followed; not,
however, without a shuddering glance at
the great door that stood suspended as if
ready to crash down upon our heads and
entomb us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just within the entrance an electric
light, doubtless fed by a storage battery,
was turned on, plainly illuminating the
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the vault lined with thick plates
of steel, riveted firmly together. In the
center was a small table and two wooden
stools. Shelves were ranged around the
walls and upon them were books, papers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and vast sums of money, both in bank-notes
and gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here,” said my companion, glancing
proudly around him, “are our sinews of war;
our records and funds and plans of operation.
Should Dom Pedro’s agents gain
access to this room they would hold in their
hands the lives and fortunes of many of the
noblest families in Brazil—and our conspiracy
would be nipped in the bud. You
may know how greatly I trust you when I
say that even my daughter does not guess
the existence of this vault. Only a few of
the Secret Council have ever gained admittance
here, and the secret of opening the
inner door is known only to myself and one
other—Francisco Paola.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Paola!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; it was he who conceived the idea
of this vault; it was his genius that planned
a door which defies any living man to open
without a clear knowledge of its secret.
Even he, its inventor, could not pass the
door without my assistance; for although he
understands the method, the means are in
my possession. For this reason I alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>am responsible for the safe-keeping of our
records and treasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The air is close and musty,” said I,
feeling oppressed in breathing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked upward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A small pipe leads to the upper air,
permitting foul vapors to escape,” said he;
“but only through the open door is fresh
air admitted. Perhaps there should be better
ventilation, yet that is an unimportant
matter, for I seldom remain long in this
place. It is a store-house—a secret crypt—not
a work-room. My custom has been to
carry all our records and papers here each
morning, after they have been in use, that
they may be safe from seizure or prying eyes.
But such trips are arduous, and I am not
very strong. Therefore I will ask you to
accompany me, hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That I shall do willingly,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we had passed through the door
on our return the chief again extinguished
the light while he manipulated the trap.
Afterward the windlass allowed the outer
plate of metal to settle firmly into place, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>we proceeded along the passage and returned
to the study.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many trips did I make to the secret
vault thereafter, but never could I understand
in what manner the great door of
shining steel was secured, as Dom Miguel
always opened and closed it while we were
in total darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the weeks rolled by I not only became
deeply interested in my work, but conceived
a still greater admiration for the one man
whose powerful intelligence directed what
I knew to be a gigantic conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Spies were everywhere about Dom Miguel.
One day we discovered his steward—an
old and trusted retainer of the family—to
be in the Emperor’s pay. But de Pintra
merely shrugged his shoulders and said
nothing. Such a person could do little to
imperil the cause, for its important secrets
could not be surprised. The grim vault
guarded them well.</p>

<p class='c000'>My duties occupying me only at night,
my days were wholly my own, and they
passed very pleasantly indeed, for my
acquaintance with Lesba Paola had ripened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>into a close friendship between us—a friendship
I was eager to resolve into a closer relation.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Lesba, although frank and ingenuous
in all our intercourse, had an effectual
way of preventing the declarations of love
which were ever on my tongue, and I found
it extremely difficult to lead our conversation
into channels that would give me an opportunity
to open my heart to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was an expert horsewoman, and we
took many long rides together, during which
she pointed out to me the estates of all the
grandees in the neighborhood. Dom Miguel,
whose love for the beautiful girl was
very evident, seemed to encourage our companionship,
and often spoke of her with
great tenderness.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would dwell with especial pride upon
the aristocratic breeding of his ward, which,
to do him justice, he valued more for its
effect upon other noble families than for any
especial advantage it lent to Lesba herself;
for while Dom Miguel was thoroughly
republican in every sense of the word, he
realized the advantages to be gained by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>interesting the best families of Brazil in the
fortunes of his beloved Cause, and one by
one he was cleverly succeeding in winning
them. My familiarity with the records
taught me that the Revolution was being
backed by the flower of Brazilian nobility—the
most positive assurance in my eyes of the
justice and timeliness of the great movement
for liberty. The idea that monarchs
derive their authority from divine sources—so
prevalent amongst the higher classes—had
dissolved before the leader’s powerful
arguments and the object lessons Dom
Pedro’s corrupt ministry constantly afforded.
All thoughtful people had come to a
realization that liberty was but a step from
darkness into light, a bursting of the shackles
that had oppressed them since the day
that Portugal had declared the province of
Brazil an Empire, and set a scion of her
royal family to rule its people with autocratic
sway.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Lesba, sprung from the bluest blood
in all the land, had great influence in awakening,
in those families she visited, an earnest
desire for a republic. Her passionate appeals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>were constantly inspiring her fellows
with an enthusiastic devotion to the cause of
liberty, and this talent was duly appreciated
by Dom Miguel, whose admiration for the
girl’s simple but direct methods of making
converts was unbounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lesba is a rebel to her very finger-tips,”
said he, “and her longing to see her country
a republic is exceeded by that of no man
among us. But we are chary of admitting
women to our councils, so my little girl must
be content to watch for the great day when
the cause of freedom shall prevail.”</p>

<p class='c000'>However, she constantly surprised me
by her intimate knowledge of our progress.
As we were riding one day she asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Were you not impressed by your visit
to the secret vault?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The secret vault!” I exclaimed. “Do
you know of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can explain every inch of its construction,”
she returned, with a laugh;
“everything, indeed, save the secret by
means of which one may gain admission.
Was it not Francisco’s idea? And is it not
exceedingly clever?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“It certainly is,” I admitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was built by foreign workmen,
brought to Brazil secretly, and for that very
purpose. Afterward the artisans were sent
home again; and not one of them, I believe,
could again find his way to my uncle’s house,
for every precaution was taken to prevent
their discovering its location.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was well done,” said I.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All that Francisco undertakes is well
done,” she answered simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>This faith in her perplexing brother was
so perfect that I never ventured to oppose
it. We could not have remained friends
had I questioned either his truth or
ability.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madam Izabel I saw but seldom, as she
avoided the society of the family and preferred
the seclusion of her own apartments.
On the rare occasions of our meeting she
treated me with frigid courtesy, resenting
any attempt upon my part to draw her into
conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time it grieved me that Dom Miguel’s
daughter should regard me with so
much obvious dislike and suspicion. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>sad story had impressed me greatly, and I
could understand how her proud nature had
resented the slanders of Francisco Paola,
and writhed under them. But one evening
an incident occurred that served to content
me with Madame Izabel’s aversion, and led
me to suspect that the Minister of Police had
not been so guilty as I had deemed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was late, and Dom Miguel had preceded
me to the domed chamber while I
carried the records and papers to be deposited
within the vault.</p>

<p class='c000'>After raising the first trap my employer,
as usual, extinguished the candle. I heard
the customary low, grating noise, but before
the shooting of the bolts reached my ears
there was a sharp report, followed by a vivid
flash, and turning instantly I beheld Madam
Isabel standing beside us, holding in her
hand a lighted match and peering eagerly
at the surface of the trap.</p>

<p class='c000'>My eyes followed hers, and while Dom
Miguel stood as if petrified with amazement
I saw the glitter of a gold ring protruding
from one of the many curious indentations
upon the plate. The next instant the match
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>was dashed from her grasp and she gave a
low cry of pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Light the candle!” commanded de
Pintra’s voice, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed. He was holding the woman
fast by her wrist. The ring had disappeared,
and the mystery of the trap seemed as inscrutable
as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel, greatly excited and muttering
imprecations all the way, dragged his
daughter through the passage and up the
stairs. I followed them silently to the chief’s
study. Then, casting the woman from him,
de Pintra confronted her with blazing eyes,
and demanded:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How dare you spy upon me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Madam Izabel had become cool as her
father grew excited. She actually smiled—a
hard, bitter smile—as she defiantly looked
into his face and answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Spy! You forget, sir, that I am your
daughter. I came to your room to seek you.
You were not here; but the door to this stairway
was displaced, and a cold air came
through it. Fearing that some danger menaced
you I passed down the stairs until,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>hearing a noise, I paused to strike a match.
You can best explain the contretemps.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Long and silently Dom Miguel gazed
upon his daughter. Then he said, abruptly,
“Leave the room!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She bowed coldly, with a mocking expression
in her dark eyes, and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she passed me I noted upon her cheeks
an unwonted flush that rendered her strikingly
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deep in thought de Pintra paced the
floor with nervous strides. Finally he
turned toward me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did you see?” he asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A ring,” I answered. “It lay upon the
trap, and the stone was fitted into one of the
numerous indentations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He passed his hand over his brow with
a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then she saw it also,” he murmured,
“and my secret is a secret no longer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I remained silent, looking upon him
curiously, but in deep sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he held out his hand. Upon
the little finger was an emerald ring, the
stone appearing to be of no exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>value. Indeed, the trinket was calculated
to attract so little attention that I had barely
noticed it before, although I remembered
that my employer always wore it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This,” said he, abruptly, “is the key to
the vault.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I nodded. The truth had flashed upon
me the moment Madam Izabel had struck
the match. And now, looking at it closely,
I saw that the stone was oddly cut, although
the fact was not likely to impress one who
was ignorant of the purpose for which it was
made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief resumed his pacing, but presently
paused to say:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If anything happens to me, my friend,
be sure to secure this ring above all else.
Get it to Paola, or to Fonseca, or Piexoto as
soon as possible—you know where they may
be found. Should it fall into the hands of
the royalists the result would be fatal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But would either of your associates be
able to use the ring, even if it passed into
their possession?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are two hundred indentations
in the door of the trap,” answered de Pintra,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“and the stone of the ring is so cut that it
fits but one of these. Still, if our friends
have time to test each cavity, they are sure
to find the right one, and then the stone of
my ring acts as a key. My real safety, as
you will observe, lay in the hope that no one
would discover that my ring unlocked the
vault. Now that Izabel has learned the
truth I must guard the ring as I would my
life—more, the lives of all our patriotic band.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Since you suspect her loyalty, why do
you not send your daughter away?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I prefer to keep her under my own eye.
And, strange as her actions of to-night seem,
I still hesitate to believe that my own child
would conspire to ruin me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The secret is not your own, sir,” I
ventured to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True,” he acknowledged, flushing deeply,
“the secret is not my own. It belongs
to the Cause. And its discovery would
jeopardize the revolution itself. For this
reason I shall keep Izabel with me, where,
admitting she has the inclination to betray
us, she will not have the power.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>After this night he did not extinguish the
light when we entered the vault, evidently
having decided to trust me fully; but he
took pains to secure the trap in the study
floor so that no one could follow us. After
watching him apply the key several times
I became confident that I could find the
right indentation without trouble should the
occasion ever arise for me to unlock the
vault unaided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Days passed by, and Madam Izabel remained
as quiet and reserved as if she had
indeed abandoned any further curiosity concerning
the secret vault. As for my fellow-rebel,
the Senhorita Lesba, I rode and
chatted with her in the firm conviction that
here, at least, was one secret connected with
the revolution of which she was ignorant.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>GENERAL FONSECA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One evening, as I entered Dom Miguel’s
library, I found myself face to face with a
strange visitor. He did not wear a mask, as
did so many of the conspirators, even in the
chief’s presence; but a long black cloak swept
in many folds from his neck to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>My first thought was to marvel at his
size, for he was considerably above six feet
in height and finely proportioned, so that
his presence fairly dominated us and made
the furnishings of the room in which he
stood seem small and insignificant.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I entered, he stood with his back to
the fireplace confronting Dom Miguel, whose
face wore a sad and tired expression. I
immediately turned to withdraw, but a gesture
from the stranger arrested me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robert,” said Dom Miguel, “I present
you to General Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>I bowed profoundly. General Fonseca
was not only a commander of the Emperor’s
royal army, but Chief Marshal of the forces
of the Revolutionary party. I had never
seen the great man before, as his duties required
his constant presence at the capital;
but no figure loomed larger than his in the
affairs of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seldom have I met with a keener or more
disconcerting glance than that which shot
from his full black eyes as I stood before him.
It seemed to search out my every thought,
and I had the sensation of being before a
judge who would show no mercy to one who
strove to dissemble in his presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the glance was brief, withal. In a
moment he had seized my hand and gripped
it painfully. Then he turned to Dom
Miguel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me hear the rest of your story,”
said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is nothing more, General. Izabel
has learned my secret, it is true; but she is
my daughter. I will vouch for her faith.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then will not I!” returned Fonseca,
in his deep, vibrant tones. “Never have I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>believed the tale of her estrangement from
that scoundrel, Leon de Mar. Men are
seldom traitors, for they dare not face the
consequences. Women have no fear of man
or devil. They are daughters of Delilah—each
and every one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned suddenly to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you also vouch for Senhora Izabel
de Mar?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And quite right, sir,” he returned, with
a grim smile. “Never trust a woman in
politics. But how about Francisco Paola?
Do you vouch for him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I hesitated, startled by the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Answer me!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot see that I am required to vouch
for any one, General,” said I, nettled by his
manner. “I am here to serve the Cause,
not to judge the loyalty of its leaders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh!” said he, contemptuously; and I
turned my back upon him, facing Dom
Miguel, over whose features a fleeting smile
passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fonseca stalked up and down the apartment,
his sword clanking beneath his cloak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and his spurs clicking like castanets. Then
he planted his huge figure before the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Watch them both,” said he brusquely;
“your daughter and your friend. They are
aware of our most important secrets.”</p>

<p class='c000'>De Pintra’s face reddened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Francisco is true as steel,” he retorted,
firmly. “Not one of us—including yourself,
General—has done more to serve the
Cause. I have learned to depend upon his
discretion as I would upon my own—or
yours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The general frowned and drew a folded
paper from his breast pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Read that,” said he, tossing it into
Dom Miguel’s hand. “It is a copy of the
report made by Paola to the Emperor this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>De Pintra glanced at the paper and then
gave it to me, at the same time dropping his
head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>I read the report. It stated that the
Minister of Police had discovered the existence
of a secret vault constructed beneath
the mansion of Miguel de Pintra, the rebel
chief. This vault, the police thought, contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>important records of the conspiracy.
It was built of double plates of steel, and the
entrance was guarded by a cleverly constructed
door, which could only be unlocked
by means of a stone set in a ring which was
constantly worn by Dom Miguel himself.
In conclusion the minister stated that every
effort was being made to secure possession
of the ring, when the rebels would be at the
Emperor’s mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, what do you think of Francisco
Paola now?” inquired Fonseca, with
a significant smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did he not himself invent the secret
vault?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He did, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How long ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A matter of two years. Is it not so,
Dom Miguel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief bowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And until now Paola has kept this secret?”
I continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Until now, yes!” said the general.
“Until the vault was stored with all our
funds and the complete records of the revolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Then it seems clear to me that Paola,
as Minister of Police, has been driven to
make this report in order to serve the
Cause.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel looked up at me quickly,
and the huge general snorted and stabbed
me with his terrible eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?” demanded Fonseca.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This report proves, I fear, that our
suspicions of Madam Izabel are well founded,”
I explained, not daring to look at Dom
Miguel while I accused his daughter. “Paola
has doubtless discovered that this information
regarding the vault and its mysterious
key has either been forwarded to the
Emperor or is on the way to him. Therefore
he has forestalled Madam Izabel’s report,
in order that he may prove his department
vigilant in serving the government, and
so protect his high office. Can you not see
that Paola’s claim that he is working to secure
the ring is but a ruse to gain time for
us? Really, he knows that he could obtain
it by arresting Dom Miguel. But this report
will prevent the Emperor putting his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>man Valcour upon the case, which he would
probably have done had he received his first
information from Izabel de Mar.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment there was silence. Then
the general’s brow unbent and he said with
cheerfulness:</p>

<p class='c000'>“This explanation is entirely reasonable.
It would not do for Paola to get himself deposed,
or even suspected, at this juncture.
A new Minister of Police would redouble
our danger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you obtain this copy of the
report?” asked de Pintra.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From one of our spies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have no doubt,” said I, “that Paola
was instrumental in sending it to you. It
is a warning, gentlemen. We must not
delay in acting upon it, and removing our
treasure and our records to a safer place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And where is that?” asked Fonseca.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked at the chief. He sat thoughtfully
considering the matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no need of immediate haste,”
said he presently, “and nothing can be done
to-night, in any event. To-morrow we will
pack everything in chests and carry them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Senhor Bastro, who has a safe hiding-place.
Meantime, General, you may leave me your
men to serve as escort. How many are
there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Three. They are now guarding the
usual approaches to this house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let them ride with you to the station at
Cruz, and send them back to me in the
morning. I will also summon some of our
nearby patriots. By noon to-morrow everything
will be ready for the transfer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good!” ejaculated the general.
“We cannot abandon too soon the vault we
constructed with so much care. Where is
your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In her apartments.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before you leave to-morrow, lock her
up and put a guard at her door. We must
not let her suspect the removal of the
records.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It shall be done,” answered de Pintra,
with a sigh. “It may be,” he continued,
hesitatingly, “that my confidence in Izabel
has been misplaced.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The general did not reply. He folded
his cloak about him, glanced at the clock,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and strode from the room without a word of
farewell.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had gone Dom Miguel turned
to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not like Fonseca,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As a man he is at times rather disagreeable,”
admitted the chief. “But as a general
he possesses rare ability, and his high
station renders him the most valuable leader
the Cause can boast. Moreover, Fonseca
has risked everything in our enterprise, and
may be implicitly trusted. When at last
we strike our great blow for freedom, much
will depend upon Manuel da Fonseca.
And now, Robert, let us retire, for an hour
before daybreak we must be at work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then eleven o’clock. I bade the
chief good night and retired to my little
room next the study. Dom Miguel slept
in a similar apartment opening from the
opposite side of the study.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exciting interview with Fonseca had
left me nervous and wakeful, and it was
some time before I sank into a restless
slumber.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>A hand upon my shoulder aroused me.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Dom Miguel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come quick, for God’s sake!” he cried,
in trembling tones. “She has stolen my
ring!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>A TERRIBLE CRIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely awake, I sprang from my couch
in time to see de Pintra’s form disappear
through the doorway. A moment later I
was in the study, which was beginning to
lighten with the dawn of a new day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trap in the floor was open, and the
chief threw himself into the aperture and
quickly descended. At once I followed,
feeling my way down the iron staircase and
along the passage. Reaching the domed
chamber a strange sight met our view.
Both traps had been raised, the second one
standing upright upon its hinged edge, and
from the interior of the vault shone a dim
light.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we hesitated the light grew stronger,
and soon Madam Izabel came slowly
from the vault with a small lamp in one hand
and a great bundle of papers in the other.
As she reached the chamber Dom Miguel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>sprang from out the shadow and wrenched
the papers from her grasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So, madam!” he cried, “you have betrayed
yourself in seeking to betray us.
Shame! Shame that a daughter of mine
should be guilty of so vile an act!” As he
spoke he struck her so sharply across the
face with the bundle of papers that she
reeled backward and almost dropped the
lamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look to her, Robert,” he said, and
leaped into the vault to restore the papers
to their place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, while I stood stupidly by, not
thinking of any further danger, Madam
Izabel sprang to the trap and with one quick
movement dashed down the heavy plate of
steel. I saw her place the ring in its cavity
and heard the shooting of the bolts; and
then, suddenly regaining my senses, I rushed
forward and seized her arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ring!” I gasped, in horror; “give
me the ring! He will suffocate in that dungeon
in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I can see yet her cold, serpent-like eyes
as they glared venomously into my own.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The next instant she dashed the lamp into
my face. It shivered against the wall, and
as I staggered backward the burning oil
streamed down my pajamas and turned me
into a living pillar of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Screaming with pain, I tore the burning
cloth from my body and stamped it into
ashes with my bare feet. Then, smarting
from the sting of many burns, I looked about
me and found myself in darkness and alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the danger that menaced
Dom Miguel flashed upon me anew, and I
stumbled up the iron stairs until I reached
the study, where I set the alarm bell going so
fiercely that its deep tones resounded
throughout the whole house.</p>

<p class='c000'>In my chamber I hastily pulled my
clothing over my smarting flesh, and as the
astonished servants came pouring into the
study, I shouted to them:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Find Senhora de Mar immediately and
bring her to me—by force if necessary. She
has murdered Dom Miguel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the heads of the stupidly staring
group I saw a white, startled face, and
Lesba’s great eyes met my own with a quick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>look of comprehension. Then she disappeared,
and I turned again to the wondering
servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make haste!” I cried. “Can you not
understand? Every moment is precious.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the frightened creatures gazed upon
each other silently, and I thrust them aside
and ran through the house in frantic search
for the murderess. The rooms were all
vacant, and when I reached the entrance
hall a groom stopped me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Senhora de Mar left the house five
minutes ago, sir. She was mounted upon
our swiftest horse, and knows every inch of
the country. It would be useless to pursue
her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While I glared at the fellow a soft hand
touched my elbow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come!” said Lesba. “Your horse is
waiting—I have saddled him myself. Make
for the station at Cruz, for Izabel will seek
to board the train for Rio.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had led me through the door across
the broad piazza; and as, half-dazed, I
mounted the horse, she added, “Tell me,
can I do anything in your absence?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Nothing!” I cried, with a sob; “Dom
Miguel is locked up in the vault, and I must
find the key—the key!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Away dashed the horse, and over my
shoulder I saw her still standing on the steps
of the piazza staring after me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The station at Cruz! I must reach it as
soon as possible—before Izabel de Mar
should escape. Almost crazed at the thought
of my impotency and shuddering at the
knowledge that de Pintra was slowly dying
in his tomb while I was powerless to assist
him, I lashed the good steed until it fairly
flew over the uneven road.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Halt!” cried a stern voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The way had led me beneath some overhanging
trees, and as I pulled the horse
back upon his haunches I caught the gleam
of a revolver held by a mounted man whose
form was enveloped in a long cloak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came a peal of light laughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, ‘tis our Americano!” said the
horseman, gayly; “whither away, my gallant
cavalier?”</p>

<p class='c000'>To my delight I recognized Paola’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Dom Miguel is imprisoned in the
vault!” I almost screamed in my agitation;
“and Madam Izabel has stolen the key.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” he answered. “And where
is Senhora Izabel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She has fled to Rio.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And left her dear father to die? How
unfilial!” he retorted, laughing again. “Do
you know, Senhor Harcliffe, it somehow
reminds me of a story my nurse used to
read me from the ‘Arabian Nights,’ how
a fond daughter planned to—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For God’s sake, sir, the man is dying!”
I cried, maddened at his indifference.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew out a leathern case and calmly
selected a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Madam Izabel has the key,” he
repeated, striking a match. “By the way,
senhor, where are you bound?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To overtake the murderess before she
can board the train at Cruz.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good. How long has Dom Miguel
been imprisoned in the vault?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twenty minutes, a half-hour, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! He may live in that foul and confined
atmosphere for two hours; possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>three. But no longer. I know, for I
planned the vault myself. And the station
at Cruz is a good two hours’ ride from
this spot. I know, for I have just traveled
it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I dropped my head, overwhelmed by
despair as the truth was thus brutally
thrust upon me. For Dom Miguel there
was no hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the records, sir! We must save
them, even if our chief is lost. Should
Madam Izabel deliver the key to her husband
or to the Emperor every leader of the
Cause may perish upon the gallows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well thought of, on my word,” commented
the strange man, again laughing
softly. “I wonder how it feels to have a
rope around one’s neck and to kick the
empty air?” He blew a cloud of smoke from
his mouth and watched it float away. “But
you are quite right, Senhor Harcliffe. The
lady must be found and made to give up the
ring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He uttered a low whistle, and two men
rode out from the shadow of the trees and
joined us.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Ride with Senhor Harcliffe to the
station at Cruz. Take there the train for
Rio. Present the American to Mazanovitch,
who is to obey his instructions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The men bowed silently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you, senhor,” I said, eagerly,
“can you not yourself assist us in this
search?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never work,” was the reply, drawled
in his mincing manner. “But the men I
have given you will do all that can be done
to assist you. For myself, I think I shall
ride on to de Pintra’s and kiss my sister
good morning. Perhaps she will give me
a bite of breakfast, who knows?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such heartlessness amazed me. Indeed,
the man was past my comprehension.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And General Fonseca?” said I, hesitating
whether or no to put myself under
Paola’s command, now that the chief was
gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let Fonseca go to the devil. He would
cry ‘I told you so!’ and refuse to aid you,
even though his own neck is in jeopardy.”
He looked at his watch. “If you delay
longer you will miss the train at Cruz.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Good morning, senhor. How sad that you
cannot breakfast with us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Touching his hat with a gesture of mock
courtesy he rode slowly on, and the next
moment, all irresolution vanishing, I put
spurs to my horse and bounded away, the
two men following at my heels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently I became tortured with
thoughts of Dom Miguel, stifling in his
tomb of steel. And under my breath I
cursed the heartless <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</span></i> of Francisco
Paola, who refused to be serious even when
his friend was dying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The cold-blooded scoundrel!” I muttered,
as I galloped on; “the cad! the
trifling coxcomb! Can nothing rouse him
from his self-complaisant idiocy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I imagine you are apostrophizing my
master, senhor,” said one of the men riding
beside me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in his voice caused me to
turn and scrutinize his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” I exclaimed, “you are Sergeant
Marco.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same, senhor. And I shall not
arrest you for the death of our dear lieutenant.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>A low chuckling laugh accompanied
the grim pleasantry. “But if you
were applying those sweet names to Senhor
Paola, I assure you that you wrong him.
For three years I have been his servant, and
this I have learned: in an emergency no
man can think more clearly or act more
swiftly than his Majesty’s Minister of
Police.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have been with him four years,”
announced the other man, in a hoarse voice,
“and I agree with you that he is cold and
heartless. Yet I never question the wisdom
of his acts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did he not come with us himself?”
I demanded, angrily. “Why should he
linger to eat a breakfast and kiss his sister
good morning, when his friend and chief
is dying, and his Cause is in imminent danger?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Marco laughed, and the other shrugged
his shoulders, disdaining a reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time we rode on in unbroken
silence, but coming to a rough bit of road
that obliged us to walk the horses, the
sergeant said:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Perhaps it would be well for you to
explain to us what has happened. My
friend Figgot, here, is a bit of a detective,
and if we are to assist you we must know in
what way our services are required.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are both patriots, senhor,” said
the other, briefly.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I told them the story of Madam
Izabel’s treachery and her theft of the ring,
after locking her father within the vault.
At their request I explained minutely the
construction of the steel doors and described
the cutting of the emerald that alone could
release the powerful bolts. They heard all
without comment, and how much of my
story was new to them I had no knowledge.
But of one thing I felt certain: these fellows
were loyal to the Cause and clever enough
to be chosen by Paola as his especial companions;
therefore they were just the assistants
I needed in this emergency.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a weary ride, and the roads
became worse as we progressed toward
Cruz. The sun had risen and now spread
a marvelous radiance over the tropical
landscape. I noted the beauty of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>morning even while smarting from the burns
upon my breast and arms, and heart-sick
at the awful fate of my beloved leader—even
now perishing amid the records of the
great conspiracy he had guided so successfully.
Was all over yet, I wondered?
Paola had said that he might live in his
prison for two or three hours. And the
limit of time had nearly passed. Poor Dom
Miguel!</p>

<p class='c000'>My horse stepped into a hole, stumbled,
and threw me headlong to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few minutes I was unconscious;
then I found myself sitting up and supported
by Sergeant Marco, while the other
man dashed water in my face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a dangerous delay,” grumbled
Marco, seeing me recovering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly I rose to my feet. No bones were
broken, but I was sadly bruised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can ride, now,” I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lifted me upon one of their horses
and together mounted the other. My own
steed had broken his leg. A bullet ended
his suffering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another half-hour and we sighted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>little station at Cruz. Perhaps I should
have explained before that from Cuyaba
to Cruz the railway made a long sweep
around the base of the hills. The station
nearest to de Pintra’s estate was Cuyaba;
but by riding straight to Cruz one saved
nearly an hour’s railway journey, and the
train for Rio could often be made in this
way when it was impossible to reach
Cuyaba in time to intercept it. And as
the station at Cruz was more isolated than
that at Cuyaba, this route was greatly
preferred by the revolutionists visiting de
Pintra.</p>

<p class='c000'>My object in riding to Cruz upon this
occasion was twofold. Had Madam Izabel
in her flight made for Cuyaba to catch the
train, I should be able to board the same
train at Cruz, and force her to give up the
ring. And if she rode to Cruz she must
await there the coming of the train we also
hoped to meet. In either event I planned,
as soon as the ring was in my possession, to
hasten back to the mansion, open the vault
and remove the body of our chief; after
which it would be my duty to convey the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>records and treasure to the safe-keeping of
Senhor Bastro.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had no expectation of finding Dom
Miguel still alive. With everything in our
favor the trip would require five hours,
and long before that time the prisoner’s
fate would have overtaken him. But the
chief’s dying wish would be to save the
records, and that I intended to do if it were
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, the delays caused by meeting
with Paola and my subsequent unlucky
fall had been fatal to my plans. We
dashed up to the Cruz station in time to see
the train for Rio disappearing in the distance,
and to complete my disappointment
we found standing beside the platform
a horse yet panting and covered with
foam.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly dismounting, I approached the
horse to examine it. The station master
came from his little house and bowed with
native politeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The horse? Ah, yes; it was from the
stables of Dom Miguel. Senhora de Mar
had arrived upon the animal just in time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to take the express for Rio. The gentleman
also wanted the train? How sad to
have missed it! But there would be another
at eleven o’clock, although not so fast a
train.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time I stood in a sort of stupor, my
mind refusing to grasp the full horror of
the situation. Until then, perhaps, a lingering
hope of saving Dom Miguel had
possessed me. But with the ring on its
way to Rio and the Emperor, and I condemned
to inaction at a deserted way-station,
it is no wonder that despair overwhelmed
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I slowly recovered my faculties
I found that my men and the station master
had disappeared. I found them in the
little house writing telegrams, which the
official was busily ticking over the wires.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing at one or two of the messages
I found them unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the secret cypher,” whispered
Figgot. “We shall put Madam Izabel in
the care of Mazanovitch himself. Ah, how
he will cling to the dear lady! She is
clever—ah, yes! exceedingly clever is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Senhora de Mar. But has Mazanovitch
his match in all Brazil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not know the gentleman,” I
returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No? Perhaps not. But you know the
Minister of Police, and Mazanovitch is the
soul of Francisco Paola.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what are we to do?” I asked,
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, now that our friends in Rio are
informed of the situation, we have transferred
to them, for a time, all our worries.
It only remains for us to await the eleven
o’clock train.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I nodded, staring at him through a sort
of haze. I was dimly conscious that my
burns were paining me terribly and that
my right side seemed pierced by a thousand
red-hot needles. Then the daylight faded
away, the room grew black, and I sank upon
the floor unconscious.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE MISSING FINGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When I recovered I was lying upon a
cot in the station-master’s private room.
Sergeant Marco had ridden to a neighboring
farmhouse and procured bandages and
some olive oil and Figgot, who proudly
informed me he had once been a surgeon,
had neatly dressed and bandaged my burns.</p>

<p class='c000'>These now bothered me less than the
lameness resulting from my fall; but I
drank a glass of wine and then lay quietly
upon the cot until the arrival of the train,
when my companions aroused me and
assisted me aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>I made the journey comfortably enough,
and felt greatly refreshed after partaking
of a substantial luncheon brought from an
eating-house by the thoughtful Figgot.</p>

<p class='c000'>On our arrival at Rio we were met by a
little, thin-faced man who thrust us all three
into a cab and himself joined us as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>began to rattle along the labyrinth of streets.
He was plainly dressed in black, quiet and
unobtrusive in manner, and had iron-gray
hair and beard, both closely cropped. I
saw at once he was not a Brazilian, and
made up my mind he was the man called
Mazanovitch by Paola and my companions.
If so, he was the person now in charge of
our quest for the ring, and with this idea I
examined his face with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was not difficult, for the man sat
opposite me with lowered eyelids and a
look of perfect repose upon his thin features.
He might have been fifty or sixty years of
age; but there was no guide in determining
this except his gray hairs, for his face bore
no lines of any sort, and his complexion,
although of pallid hue, was not unhealthy
in appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It surprised me that neither he nor my
companions asked any questions. Perhaps
the telegrams had explained all that was
necessary. Anyway, an absolute silence
reigned in the carriage during our brief
drive.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we came to a stop the little man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>opened the door. We all alighted and
followed him into a gloomy stone building.
Through several passages we walked, and
then our conductor led us into a small
chamber, bare except for a half-dozen iron
cots that stood in a row against the wall.
A guard was at the doorway, but admitted
us with a low bow after one glance at the
man in black.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leading us to the nearest cot, Mazanovitch
threw back a sheet and then stood
aside while we crowded around it. To my
horror I saw the form of Madam Izabel lying
dead before us. Her white dress was
discolored at the breast with clots of dark
blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stabbed to the heart,” said the guard,
calmly. “It was thus they brought her
from the train that arrived this afternoon
from Matto Grosso. The assassin is unknown.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mazanovitch thrust me aside, leaned
over the cot, and drew the woman’s left
hand from beneath the sheet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little finger had been completely
severed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Very gently he replaced the hand, drew
the sheet over the beautiful face, and
turned away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Filled with amazement at the Nemesis
that had so soon overtaken this fierce and
terrible woman, I was about to follow our
guide when I found myself confronting a
personage who stood barring my way with
folded arms and a smile of grim satisfaction
upon his delicate features.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Valcour—the man who had
called himself de Guarde on board the
Castina—the Emperor’s spy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, my dear Senhor Harcliffe! Do we
indeed meet again?” he cried, tauntingly.
“And are you still keeping a faithful record
in that sweet diary of yours? It is fine
reading, that diary—perhaps you have it
with you now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me pass,” said I, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet, my dear friend,” he answered,
laughing. “You are going to be my guest,
you know. Will it not please you to enjoy
my society once more? To be sure. And
I—I shall not wish to part with you again
soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“What do you mean?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only that I arrest you, Robert Harcliffe,
in the name of the Emperor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On what charge?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murder, for one,” returned the smiling
Valcour. “Afterward you may answer for
conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me, Senhor Valcour,” said the
little man, in a soft voice. “The gentleman
is already under arrest—in the Emperor’s
name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour turned upon him fiercely, but
his eyes fell as he encountered the other’s
passive, unemotional countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it so, Captain Mazanovitch? Then
I will take the prisoner off your hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The little man spread out his palms
with an apologetic, deprecating gesture.
His eyes seemed closed—or nearly so. He
seemed to see nothing; he looked at neither
Valcour nor myself. But there was something
about the still, white face, with its
frame of iron-gray, that compelled a certain
respect, and even deference.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is greatly to be regretted,” he said,
gently; “and it grieves me to be obliged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>disappoint you, Senhor Valcour. But since
this man is a prisoner of the police—a
state prisoner of some importance, I believe—it
is impossible to deliver him into your
hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without answer Valcour stood motionless
before us, only his mobile face and
his white lips showing the conflict of
emotions that oppressed him. And then I
saw a curious thing happen. The eyelids of
Mazanovitch for an instant unclosed, and
in that instant so tender a glance escaped
them that Valcour trembled slightly, and
touched with a gentle, loving gesture the
elder man’s arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>It all happened in a flash, and the next
moment I could not have sworn that my
eyes had not deceived me, for Valcour
turned away with a sullen frown upon his
brow, and the Captain seized my arm and
marched me to the door, Figgot and Marco
following close behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently we regained our carriage and
were driven rapidly from the morgue.</p>

<p class='c000'>This drive was longer than the first, but
during it no word was spoken by any of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>companions. I could not help staring at
the closed eyes of Mazanovitch, but the
others, I noticed, avoided looking at him.
Did he see, I wondered?—<em>could</em> he see
from out the tiny slit that showed beneath
his lashes?</p>

<p class='c000'>We came at last to a quiet street lined
with small frame houses, and before one
of these the carriage stopped. Mazanovitch
opened the front door with a latchkey,
and ushered us into a dimly lighted
room that seemed fitted up as study and
office combined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not until we were seated and supplied
with cigars did the little man speak. Then
he reclined in a cushioned chair, puffed at
his cheroot, and turned his face in my
direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me all you know concerning the
vault and the ring which unlocks it,” he
said, in his soft tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed. Afterward Figgot told of my
meeting with the Minister of Police, and
of Paola’s orders to him and Marco to
escort me to Rio and to place the entire
matter in the hands of Mazanovitch.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The little man listened without comment
and afterward sat for many minutes silently
smoking his cheroot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems to me,” said I, at last, “that
the death of Senhora de Mar, and especially
the fact that her ring finger has been severed
from her hand, points conclusively to one
reassuring fact; that the ring has been
recovered by one of our band, and so the
Cause is no longer endangered. Therefore
my mission to Rio is ended, and all that
remains for me is to return to Cuyaba and
attend to the obsequies of my poor friend
de Pintra.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Marco and Figgot heard me respectfully,
but instead of replying both gazed questioningly
at the calm face of Mazanovitch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The facts are these;” said the latter,
deliberately; “Senhora de Mar fled with
the ring; she has been murdered, and the
ring taken from her. By whom? If a
patriot has it we shall know the truth within
fifteen minutes.” I glanced at a great
clock ticking against the wall. “Before
your arrival,” he resumed, “I had taken
steps to communicate with every patriot in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Rio. Yet there were few able to recognize
the ring as the key to the secret vault, and
the murder was committed fifteen minutes
after the train left Cruz.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I started, at that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who could have known?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little man took the cigar from his
mouth for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the train,” said he, “were General
Fonseca, the patriot, and Senhor Valcour,
the Emperor’s spy.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>“FOR TO-MORROW WE DIE!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I remembered Fonseca’s visit of the night
before, and considered it natural he should
take the morning train to the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But Valcour would not need to murder
Madam Izabel,” said I. “They were
doubtless in the plot together, and she would
have no hesitation in giving him the ring
had he demanded it. On the contrary,
our general was already incensed against
the daughter of the chief, and suspected her
of plotting mischief. I am satisfied he has
the ring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The general will be with us presently,”
answered Mazanovitch, quietly. “But,
gentlemen, you all stand in need of refreshment,
and Senhor Harcliffe should have
his burns properly dressed. Kindly follow
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He led the way up a narrow flight of
stairs that made two abrupt turns—for no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>apparent reason—before they reached the
upper landing. Following our guide we
came to a back room where a table was set
for six. A tall, studious-looking Brazilian
greeted us with a bow and immediately
turned his spectacled eyes upon me. On
a small side table were bandages, ointments,
and a case of instruments lying open.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within ten minutes the surgeon had
dressed all my wounds—none of which,
however, was serious, merely
uncomfortable—and I felt greatly benefited by the
application of the soothing ointments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely was the operation completed
when the door opened to admit Fonseca.
He gave me a nod, glanced questioningly
at the others, and then approached the
table and poured out a glass of wine, which
he drank eagerly. I noticed he was in full
uniform.</p>

<p class='c000'>“General,” said I, unable to repress my
anxiety, “have you the ring?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook his head and sat down with a
gloomy expression upon his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I slept during the journey from Cuyaba,”
he said presently, “and only on my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>arrival at Rio did I discover that Senhora
de Mar had traveled by the same train.
She was dead when they carried her into
the station.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Valcour?” It was Mazanovitch
who asked the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Valcour was beside the body, wild
with excitement, and swearing vengeance
against the murderer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be seated, gentlemen,” requested our
host, approaching the table. “We have
time for a slight repast before our friends
arrive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I join you?” asked a high, querulous
voice. A slender figure, draped in
black and slightly stooping, stood in the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come in,” said Fonseca, and the new
arrival threw aside his cloak and sat with
us at the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The last supper, eh?” he said, in a
voice that quavered somewhat. “For to-morrow
we die. Eh, brothers?—to-morrow
we die!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Croaker!” cried Fonseca, with scorn.
“Die to-morrow, if you like; die to-night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>for all I care. The rest of us intend to live
long enough to shout huzzas for the United
States of Brazil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In truth, Senhor Piexoto,” said Marco,
who was busily eating, “we are in no unusual
danger to-night.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Startled by the mention of the man’s
name, I regarded him with sudden interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reputation of Floriano Piexoto, the
astute statesman who had plotted so well
for the revolutionary party, was not unknown
to me, by any means. Next to
Fonseca no patriot was more revered by
the people of Brazil; yet not even the general
was regarded with the same unquestioning
affection. For Piexoto was undoubtedly
a friend of the people, and despite his personal
peculiarities had the full confidence
of that rank and file of the revolutionary
party upon which, more than upon the
grandees who led it, depended the fate of
the rising republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>His smooth-shaven face, sunken cheeks,
and somewhat deprecating gaze gave him
the expression of a student rather than a
statesman, and his entire personality was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>sharp contrast to the bravado of Fonseca.
To see the two leaders together one would
never suspect that history would prove the
statesman greater than the general.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Danger!” piped Piexoto, shrilly, in
answer to Sergeant Marco’s remark, “you
say there is no danger? Is not de Pintra
dead? Is not the ring gone? Is not the
secret vault at the Emperor’s mercy?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who knows?” answered Fonseca, with
a shrug.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And who is this?” continued Piexoto,
turning upon me a penetrating gaze. “Ah,
the American secretary, I suppose. Well,
sir, what excuse have you to make for
allowing all this to happen under your very
nose? Are you also a traitor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have not the honor of your acquaintance,
senhor,” said I, stiffly; “nor, in view
of your childish conduct, do I greatly
desire it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Fonseca laughed, and the Pole turned his
impassive face, with its half-closed eyelids,
in my direction. But Piexoto seemed
rather pleased with my retort, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind; your head sits as insecurely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>upon its neck as any present. ‘Tis
really a time for action rather than recrimination.
What do you propose, Mazanovitch?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am waiting to hear if you have discovered
the present possessor of the ring,”
answered the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; our people were ignorant of its
very existence, save in a few cases, and none
of them has seen it. Therefore the Emperor
has it, without doubt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why without doubt?” asked Mazanovitch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who else could desire it? Who else
could know its value? Who else would
have murdered Madam Izabel to secure it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why the devil should the Emperor
cause his own spy to be murdered?” inquired
Fonseca, in his harsh voice. “You
are a fool, Piexoto.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What of Leon de Mar?” asked the
other, calmly. “He hated his wife. Why
should he not have killed her himself, in
order to be rid of her and at the same time
secure the honor of presenting his Emperor
with the key to the secret vault?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Leon de Mar,” said Mazanovitch, “is
in Rio Grande do Sul. He has been
stationed there for three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time there was silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is Paola?” suddenly asked Piexoto.
“I want to know what Paola is doing
in this crisis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was last seen near de Pintra’s
residence,” said Figgot. “But we know
nothing of his present whereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may be sure of one thing,” declared
Marco stoutly; “that Francisco Paola is
serving the Cause, wherever he may be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The general snorted derisively, and
Piexoto looked at him with the nearest
approach to a smile his anxious face had
shown.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How we admire one another!” he
murmured.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Personally I detest both you and
Paola,” responded the general, frankly.
“But the Cause is above personalities, and
as for your loyalty, I dare not doubt it. But
we wander from the subject in hand. Has
the Emperor the ring or is he seeking it as
eagerly as we are?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“The Emperor has not the ring,” said
Mazanovitch, slowly; “you may be assured
of that. Otherwise—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Piexoto gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To be sure,” said he, “otherwise we
would not be sitting here.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>LESBA’S BRIGHT EYES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Later that evening there was a large
gathering of the important members of the
conspiracy, but the result of their deliberations
only served to mystify us more than
before as to the murderer of Madam Izabel
and the possessor of the ring. Many were
the expressions of sorrow at the terrible
fate of Dom Miguel—a man beloved by
all who had known him. The sad incident
of his death caused several to waver
in their loyalty to the projected Republic,
and I was impressed by the fact that at this
juncture the Cause seemed to be in rather
desperate straits.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the ring is gone and the records discovered,”
said one, “we would best leave
the country for a time, until the excitement
subsides, for the Emperor will spare no
one in his desire for vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us first wait for more definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>information,” counseled the old general,
always optimistic. “Should an uprising
be precipitated at this time we have all the
advantage on our side, for the Republic is
to-day stronger than the Empire. And
we have yet to hear from Paola.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So, after much comment, it was determined
to watch every action of the court
party with redoubled vigilance, and in case
danger threatened the republicans, to give
the signal that would set the revolution
going in full swing. Meantime we would
endeavor to get in touch with Paola.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Minister of Police had mysteriously
disappeared, and although telegrams
were sent in every direction, we could hear
nothing of Paola’s whereabouts. Inquiries
at the court failed to elicit any information
whatever, and they were doubtless as
ignorant on the subject as ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Officially, I was supposed to be occupying
a dungeon in the fortress, and Mazanovitch
had actually locked up a man under
my name, registering the prisoner in the
prescribed fashion. Therefore, being
cleverly disguised by the detective, I ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>little risk of interference should I venture
abroad in the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Curiously enough, Mazanovitch chose
to disguise me as a member of the police,
saying that this plan was less likely than
any other to lead to discovery. Wherever I
might wander I was supposed to be off
duty or on special service, and the captain
enrolled me under the name of Andrea
Subig.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was anxious at times to return to
Cuyaba, for Lesba’s white face, as I had
last seen it on the morning of Dom Miguel’s
incarceration, haunted me perpetually. But
the quest of the ring was of vital importance,
and I felt that I dared not return until I
could remove my dear friend’s body from
the vault and see it properly interred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under Mazanovitch’s directions I strove
earnestly to obtain a clue that might lead
to a knowledge of where the missing ring
was secreted; but our efforts met with no
encouragement, and we were not even sure
that the murderer of Izabel de Mar had
ever reached the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the third morning after my arrival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>I was strolling down the street toward the
railway station, in company with Mazanovitch,
when suddenly I paused and grasped
my comrade’s arm convulsively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look there!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mazanovitch shook off my hand, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see,” he returned; “it is the Senhorita
Lesba Paola, riding in the Emperor’s
carriage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that scoundrel Valcour is with
her!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Scoundrel? We do not call Senhor
Valcour that. He is faithful to the Emperor,
who employs him. Shall we, who are
unfaithful, blame him for his fidelity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>While I sought an answer to this disconcerting
query the carriage whirled past
us and disappeared around a corner; but
I had caught a glimpse of Lesba’s bright
eyes glancing coyly into the earnest face
Valcour bent over her, and the sight filled
me with pain and suspicion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Listen, Captain,” said I, gloomily,
“that girl knows all the important secrets
of the conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“True,” answered the unmoved Mazanovitch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And she is riding in the Emperor’s
carriage, in confidential intercourse with
the Emperor’s spy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“True,” he said again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Paola has disappeared, and his sister
is at court. What do you make of it,
senhor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me, the Minister of Police
returned to his duties this morning,” said
the man, calmly. “Doubtless his sister
accompanied him. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you not tell me this?” I demanded,
angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am waiting for Paola to communicate
with us, which he will do in good time.
Meanwhile, let me counsel patience, Senhor
Americano.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But I left him and strode down the street,
very impatient indeed, and filled with
strange misgivings. These Brazilians were
hard to understand, and were it not for
Lesba I could wish myself quit of their
country forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lesba? What strange chance had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>brought her to Rio and thrown her into the
companionship of the man most inimical
to her brother, to myself, and to the Cause?</p>

<p class='c000'>Was she playing a double game? Could
this frank, clear-eyed girl be a traitor to the
Republic, as had been Izabel de Mar?</p>

<p class='c000'>It might be. A woman’s mind is hard
to comprehend. But she had been so
earnest a patriot, so sincerely interested
in our every success, so despondent over
our disappointments, that even now I
could not really doubt her faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, I loved the girl. Had I never
before realized the fact, I knew it in this
hour when she seemed lost to me forever.
For never had speech of mine brought
the glad look to her face that I had noted as
she flashed by with Valcour pouring soft
speeches into her ears. The Emperor’s
spy was a handsome fellow; he was high
in favor at court; he was one of her own
people—</p>

<p class='c000'>Was he, by the by? Was Valcour
really a Brazilian? He had a Brazilian’s
dark eyes and complexion, it is true; yet
now that I thought upon it, there was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>odd, foreign cast to his features that indicated
he belonged to another race. Yes,
there was a similarity between them and
the features of the Pole Mazanovitch.
Perhaps Valcour might also be a Pole.
Just now Mazanovitch had spoken kindly
of him, and——</p>

<p class='c000'>I stopped short in my calculations, for I
had made a second startling discovery.
My wanderings had led me to the railway
station, where, as I approached, I saw the
Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro de Alcantara,
surrounded by a company of his
Uruguayan guard, and in the act of boarding
a private car attached to the Matto
Grosso train.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had never before seen the Emperor,
but from descriptions of him, as well as
from the deference of those about him, I
had no doubt of his identity.</p>

<p class='c000'>His hurried departure upon a journey,
coupled with Paola’s presence at the capital,
could only bear one interpretation. The
Minister of Police had been in conference
with the Emperor, and his Majesty was
about to visit in person the scene of the late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>tragedy, and do what he might to unearth
the records of that far-reaching revolution
which threatened his throne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was news, indeed! Half-dazed,
I started to retrace my steps, when a soft
voice beside me said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you money, senhor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then,” continued Mazanovitch, “you
must take this train for Cuyaba. Let the
Emperor guide you. If danger threatens
us, telegraph me the one word, ‘Lesba’!
Do you understand, Senhor Harcliffe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think so,” said I, “but let me use
some other word. Why drag a woman’s
name into this affair?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He coughed slightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a word you will remember,” said
he. “Good by to you, senhor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He had an odd way of disappearing,
this strange Pole, whose eyes I had never
seen. With his last word he actually
melted into the crowd of loiterers who were
watching the Emperor’s departure, and I
could not have found him again had I so
desired.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>My first thought was to rebel at leaving
Rio, where Lesba Paola had taken refuge
from the coming storm. But the girl seemed
amply amused without me, and my duties
to the interests of my dead chieftain forbade
my deserting the Cause at this crisis.
Therefore I would follow the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the train moved slowly out of the
station, I swung myself upon the steps of
the rear car, and the next instant was tumbled
upon the platform by a person who
sprang up behind me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Angrily protesting, I scrambled to my
feet; but the fellow, with scarcely a glance
in my direction, passed into the car and
made his way forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exclamations died suddenly upon
my lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>The belated passenger was Senhor Valcour,
the spy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'>THE MAN IN THE SHRUBBERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The name of an Emperor is a fine thing
to conjure with. When we arrived at the
station at Cuyaba at early evening a score
of saddle-horses and several carriages were
awaiting the royal party.</p>

<p class='c000'>I stood in the shadows of the station
and watched the guardsmen mount and
surround the equipage in which their
imperial master seated himself. His civic
companions—men of high rank, evidently—occupied
the other carriages; and then
the entire cavalcade swept away into the
gloom and left me alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The station agent was known to me as a
patriot, but he was still bobbing his head
after the royal party when I accosted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get me a horse, Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A horse! Ah, your excellency is joking.
Every horse that could be found has been
impressed by the Emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Anything will do. A nag of any sort,
with saddle or cart, will answer my purpose.
The Cause demands it, Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am powerless, your excellency. Absolutely
powerless!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was true enough. The only way for
me to get to de Pintra’s mansion was on
foot, and after inducing the man to give me
a peasant’s dress in exchange for my police
uniform, I set out at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long and gloomy walk. There
was a moon, but large banks of clouds were
drifting across the sky, and the way was
obscured more than half the time, causing
me to go slowly in order to avoid stumbling
into the ditches.</p>

<p class='c000'>I met no one on the road, for the highways
were usually deserted at this hour,
and the silence all about me added its
depressing influence to the anxiety of my
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor’s advent into this stronghold
of the Revolution indicated that at
last he had determined to act and suppress
the conspiracy that had grown to such huge
proportions. With the real leader—“the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>brains of the revolt,” as de Pintra was
called—out of the way, Dom Pedro doubtless
had concluded he could easily crush the
remainder of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his success, I argued, would depend
upon his securing the key to the secret
vault, for without that the records would
never come into his possession.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did he have the key? Was this the
explanation of his sudden activity? The
thought made me hasten my steps, but
although I put forth my best efforts it was
close upon midnight before I sighted the
great hedge that surrounded de Pintra’s
mansion. I half-expected to find the gateway
guarded, but to my relief the avenue
was as deserted as the highway had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cautiously I passed along the drive
leading to the mansion. I am not usually
nervous at such times, but something in the
absolute stillness of the scene, something
menacing in the deep shadows cast by the
great trees, unnerved me and made me
suspicious of my surrounding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once, indeed, I fancied that I heard a
stealthy footstep advancing to meet me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and with a bound I sprang from the driveway
and crouched among the thick shrubbery,
listening intently. But after a few
moments I became reassured and resumed
my journey, avoiding this time the graveled
drive and picking my way noiselessly across
the grass, skirting the endless array of
flower-beds and shrubbery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately the moon came out, or I
might have lost my way; and before long
the black line of shadow cast by the mansion
itself fell at my feet. Peering ahead,
I saw that I had approached the right wing
of the house. It was here that my own
room was located, and with a low exclamation
of relief I was about to step forward
into the path when my eyes fell upon
a sight that caused me to suddenly halt and
recoil in horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a man’s arm showing white in the
moonlight, and extending from beneath a
clump of low bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments I gazed at it as if
fascinated, but quickly recovering myself
I advanced to the bushes and gently withdrew
the body until it lay exposed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>full rays of the moon. I fully expected to
recognize one of our conspirators, but when
I turned the man over a face was disclosed
that was wholly unknown to me—that
of a dark, swarthy person of evident intelligence
and refinement.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been shot squarely between the
eyes, and doubtless had met death instantly.
I was about to consider the man a government
spy who had been killed by Paola or
some other of the conspirators, when I
discovered, with a start of dismay, that the
man’s left hand had been completely severed
at the wrist. Also the hand was missing,
and although I searched the ground carefully
in the neighborhood, I could find no
trace of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This discovery gave me ample food for
thought. The only plausible reason for the
hasty amputation of the hand had doubtless
been to secure a ring which the dead man
had worn—the secret key to Dom Miguel’s
vault probably, since the murder had been
committed at this place.</p>

<p class='c000'>In whose possession, then, was the ring
now? Madam Izabel, the Emperor’s spy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>had first stolen it. Then another had
murdered her for its possession—not a
conspirator, for all had denied any knowledge
of the ring. Could it have been the
man who now lay dead before me? And,
if so, who was he? And had the government
again managed to secure the
precious jewel and to revenge Madam
Izabel’s assassination by mutilating this
victim in the same way that she had been
served?</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the dead man was not one of the
few leaders of the conspiracy who knew the
secret of the ring, how should he have
learned its value, and risked his life to
obtain it from Madam Izabel?</p>

<p class='c000'>That, however, was of no vital importance.
The main thing was that the
ring had been taken from him, and had
once more changed ownership.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps Paola, lurking near his uncle’s
mansion, had encountered this person and
killed him to get the ring. If so, had he
carried it to the Emperor? And was this
the explanation of Dom Pedro’s sudden
visit to de Pintra’s residence?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Yet what object could Paola have in
betraying the conspiracy at this juncture?</p>

<p class='c000'>Filled with these thoughts I was about
to proceed to the house, when a sudden
thought induced me to stoop and feel of the
murdered man’s arm. <em>The flesh was still
warm!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>The murder had been done that very
evening—perhaps within the hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>I own that the horror of the thing and
the reckless disregard of life evinced in this
double murder for the possession of the
ring, warned me against proceeding further
in the matter; and for the moment I had
serious thoughts of returning quietly to
Rio and taking the first steamer for New
Orleans. But there were reasons for remaining.
One was to get possession in
some way of Dom Miguel’s body and see
it decently buried; for he was my uncle’s
friend, as well as my own, and I could not
honorably return home and admit that I had
left him lying within the dungeon where
his doom had overtaken him. The second
reason I could not have definitely explained.
Perhaps it was curiosity to see the adventure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>to the end, or a secret hope that the
revolution was too powerful to be balked.
And then there was Lesba! At any rate, I
resolved not to desert the Cause just yet,
although acknowledging it to be the wisest
and safest course to pursue.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, summoning all my resolution and
courage to my aid, I crept to the window
of my room and, by a method that I had
many times before made use of, admitted
myself to the apartment.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had seen no lights whatever shining
from the windows, and the house—as I
stood still and listened—seemed absolutely
deserted. I felt my way to a shelf,
found a candle, and lighted it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I turned around and faced the
barrel of a revolver that was held on a
level with my eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are our prisoner, senhor!” said a
voice, stern but suppressed. “I beg you
to offer no resistance.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>DOM PEDRO DE ALCANTARA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I held the candle steadily and stared at
my captor. He was dressed in the uniform
of an officer of the royal guards—the body
commanded by Fonseca. At his back were
two others, silent but alert.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are here in the service of General
da Fonseca?” I asked, with assumed composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the Emperor’s service, senhor,”
answered the officer, quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the general—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The general is unaware of our mission.
I have my orders from his Majesty in person.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled somewhat unpleasantly as he
made this statement, and for the first time
I realized that my arrest might prove a
great misfortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me if I appear discourteous,”
he continued, and made a sign to his men.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>One took the candle from my hand and
the other snapped a pair of hand-cuffs over
my wrists.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had no spirit to resist. The surprise
had been so complete that it well-nigh
benumbed my faculties. I heard the officer’s
voice imploring me in polite tones to
follow, and then my captors extinguished
the candle and marched me away through a
succession of black passages until we had
reached an upper room at the back of the
house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a door quickly opened and I was
thrust into a blaze of light so brilliant that
it nearly blinded me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blinking my eyes to accustom them to
the glare, I presently began to note my surroundings,
and found myself standing before
a table at which was seated the Emperor
of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c000'>Involuntarily I bowed before his Majesty.
He was a large man, of commanding
appearance, with dark eyes that seemed to
read one through and through. Behind
him stood a group of four men in civilian
attire, while the other end of the room was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>occupied by a squad of a dozen soldiers of
the Uruguayan guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A prisoner, your Majesty,” said the
officer, saluting. “One evidently familiar
with the house, for he obtained entrance to a
room adjoining Dom Miguel’s library.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor turned from the papers
that littered the table and eyed me gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your name!” said he, in a stern voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hesitated; but remembering that officially
I was occupying a dungeon in Rio I
decided to continue the deception of my
present disguise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Andrea Subig, your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some one laughed softly beside me. I
turned and saw Valcour at my elbow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the American secretary, your Majesty,
one Robert Harcliffe by name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The spy spoke in his womanish, dainty
manner, and with such evident satisfaction
that I could have strangled him with much
pleasure had I been free.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you here?” inquired the Emperor,
after eyeing me curiously for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have some personal belongings in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>house which I wished to secure before returning
to the United States. Your men
arrested me in the room I have been occupying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you anxious to return to the
United States?” questioned the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because my mission to Brazil is ended.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is true,” returned Dom Pedro, positively.
“The conspiracy is at an end.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of that I am not informed,” I replied
evasively. “But I have been employed by
Dom Miguel de Pintra, not by the conspiracy,
as your Majesty terms it. And Dom
Miguel has no further need of me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dom Miguel is dead,” retorted the
Emperor, with an accent of triumph in his
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murdered by his daughter, your spy,”
I added, seeing that he was aware of the
truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>He merely shrugged his broad shoulders
and turned to whisper to a gray-bearded
man behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This conspiracy must be summarily
dealt with,” resumed the Emperor, turning
to me again, “and as there is ample evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>that you are guilty of treason, Senhor Harcliffe,
I shall order you put to death unless
you at once agree to give us such information
as may be in your possession.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am an American citizen and entitled
to a fair trial,” I answered, boldly enough.
“You dare not assassinate me. For if I
am injured in any way the United States will
call you to full account.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a matter of treason, sir!” returned
the Emperor, harshly. “Your citizenship
will not protect you in this case. I have
myself visited your country and been
received there with great courtesy. And
no one knows better than I that your countrymen
would repudiate one who came to
Brazil for the treasonable purpose of dethroning
its legitimate Emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That was true enough, and I remained
silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you give us the required information?”
he demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was curious to know how much the
royalists had learned, and in what position
the republicans had been placed by this
imperial visit to their headquarters. Dom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Pedro had said that the conspiracy was at
an end; but I did not believe that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure you err in believing me to be
in the secret counsels of the republicans,”
I said, after a moment’s thought. “I was
merely employed in the capacity of private
secretary to Dom Miguel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you know of the underground
vault? You have visited it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Often,” I replied, seeing no harm in
the acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you open it for us?” he demanded.
I laughed, for the question exposed to
me his real weakness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your Majesty must be well aware that
there is but one key,” I replied, “and
without that secret key I am as powerless
as you are to open the vault.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is the key?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not know. Senhora de Mar stole
it from Dom Miguel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And it was taken from her by one of
your conspirators.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you traced it no farther?” I inquired,
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“My men are now investigating the matter,”
said he. “Doubtless the ring will soon
be in our possession.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how about the murdered man in
the shrubbery?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The royalists exchanged glances, and
one or two uttered exclamations of surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there a murdered man in the shrubbery,
Captain de Souza?” questioned the
Emperor, sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not that I know of, your Majesty,”
returned the officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I found him as I approached the house,”
said I. “He has been shot within the hour,
and his left hand severed at the wrist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that my news startled
them. When I had described the location
of the body some of the soldiers were sent
to fetch it, and during their absence the Emperor
resumed his questioning. I told him
frankly that none of the records of the republicans
was in my possession, and that
whatever knowledge I had gained of the
conspiracy or the conspirators could not be
drawn from me by his threats of death. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>now I began to understand that this visit to
Dom Miguel’s house was a secret one, and
that the royalists were as much in the dark
as ever regarding the conspiracy itself or the
whereabouts of its leaders. One thing only
they knew—that the records were lying with
Dom Miguel’s dead body in the secret vault,
and that the ring which opened it was missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before long the soldiers bore the body
of the latest victim of the fatal ring into the
presence of the Emperor, and Valcour bent
over it eagerly for a moment, and then shook
his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man is a stranger,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others present endeavored to identify
the murdered man, but were equally unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could see by their uneasy looks that
they were all suspicious of one another; for
Captain de Souza protested that no shot
could have been fired without some of his
men hearing it, and the fact that the ring
they sought had been so recently within
their very reach led them to believe it might
not now be very far away.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>For all the Emperor’s assumed calmness,
I knew he was greatly disturbed by this last
murder, as well as by the impotency of his
spies to discover the whereabouts of the
ring. When Valcour suggested, in his soft
voice, that I had myself killed the fellow in
the shrubbery, and had either secreted the
ring or had it now in my possession, they
pounced upon me eagerly, and I was subjected
to a thorough search and afterward
to severe questioning and many fierce
threats.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments the Emperor listened
to the counsels of the group of advisors that
stood at his back, and then ordered me
safely confined until he had further use
for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officer therefore marched me away
to the front of the house, where, still securely
hand-cuffed, I was thrust into a small chamber
and left alone. The key was turned in
the lock and I heard the soft foot-falls of a
guard pacing up and down outside the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long walk from the station and the
excitement of the last hour had greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>wearied me; so I groped around in the dark
until I found the bed with which the room
was provided, and soon had forgotten all
about the dreary conspiracy in a refreshing
sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <span class='large'>THE MAN WITH THE RING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Toward morning a tramping of feet
aroused me; the door was thrust open long
enough for another prisoner to be admitted,
and then I heard the bolts shoot into their
fastening and the soldiers march away.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not quite dark in the room, for the
shutters were open and admitted a ray of
moonlight through the window. So I lay
still and strained my eyes to discover who
my companion might be.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood motionless for a time in the place
the soldiers had left him. I made out that
he was tall and stooping, and exceedingly
thin; but his face was in shadow. Presently,
as he moved, I heard a chain clank, and
knew he was hand-cuffed in the same manner
as myself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly he turned his body, peering into
every corner of the room, so that soon he
discovered me lying where the moonlight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>was strongest. He gave a start, then, but
spoke no word; and again an interval of
absolute silence ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>His strange behavior began to render me
uneasy. It is well to know something of a
person confined with you in a small room at
the dead of night, and I was about to address
the fellow when he began stealthily approaching
the bed. He might have been
three yards distant when I arose to a sitting
posture. This caused him to pause, his
form well within the streak of light. Resting
upon the edge of the bed and facing him,
my own features were clearly disclosed, and
we examined each other curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had never seen him before, and I had
little pleasure in meeting him then. He
appeared to be a man at least fifty years of
age, with pallid, sunken cheeks, eyes bright,
but shifting in their gaze, and scanty gray
locks that now hung disordered over a low
forehead. His form was thin and angular,
his clothing of mean quality, and his hands,
which dangled before him at the ends of the
short chain, were large and hardened by
toil.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Not a Brazilian, I decided at once; but
I could not then determine his probable
nationality.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Likewise a prisoner, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>?” he inquired,
in an indistinct, mumbling tone,
and with a strong accent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, conspirator. I see; I see!” He
nodded his head several times, and then
growled sentences that I could not understand.</p>

<p class='c000'>While I stared at him he turned away
again, and with a soft and stealthy tread
made the entire circuit of the room, feeling
of each piece of furniture it contained, and
often pausing for many moments in one
spot as if occupied in deep thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he approached the bed again,
dragging after him a chair in which he slowly
seated himself opposite me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Retain your couch, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>,” he muttered.
“I shall not disturb you, and it will
soon be morning. You may sleep.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But I was now fully awake, and had no
intention of sleeping while this strange individual
occupied his seat beside me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Who are you?” I demanded. “A patriot?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not as you use the term,” he answered,
at once. “I am Mexican.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mexican!” I echoed, surprised. “Do
you speak English?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Truly, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>,” he answered, but his
English was as bad as his Portuguese.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you here and a prisoner?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had business with <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor de Pintra</span>.
I came from afar to see him, but found the
soldiers inhabiting his house. I am timid,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>, and suspecting trouble I hid in an
out-building, where the soldiers discovered
me. Why I should be arrested I do not
know. I am not conspirator; I am not even
Brazilian. I do not care for your politics
whatever. They tell me Miguel de Pintra
is dead. Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c000'>His tone did not seem sincere. But I replied
it was true that Dom Miguel was dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I should be allowed to depart.
But not so. They tell me the great Emperor
is here, their Dom Pedro, and he will
speak to me in the morning. Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>This time I detected an anxiety in his
voice that told me he had not suspected the
Emperor’s presence until his arrest.</p>

<p class='c000'>But I answered that Dom Pedro was then
occupying de Pintra’s mansion, together
with many of his important ministers.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time he remained silent, probably
considering the matter with care. But he
was ill at ease, and shifted continually in his
chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are Americano?” he asked at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said I.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew, when you ask me for my English.
But why does the Emperor arrest an
American?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I smiled; but there was no object in trying
to deceive him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was private secretary to Dom Miguel,”
said I, “and they suspect my late master
to have plotted against the Emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed, unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is well your master is dead when they
make that suspicion,” said he; then paused
a moment and asked, abruptly, “Did he
tell you of the vault?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I stared at him. A Mexican, not a conspirator,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>yet aware of the secret vault! It
occurred to me that it would be well to keep
my own counsel, for a time, at least.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A vault?” I asked, carelessly, and shook
my head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the fellow laughed disagreeably.
But my answer seemed to have pleased him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was sly! Ah, he was sly, the dear
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor</span> Miguel!” he chuckled, rocking his
thin form back and forth upon the chair.
“But never mind. It is nothing. I never
pry into secrets, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>. It is not my nature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I said nothing and another silent fit
seized him. Perhaps five minutes had
passed before he arose and made a second
stealthy circuit of the room, this time examining
the barred window with great care.
Then he sighed heavily and came back to
his seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will be your fate, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall appeal to our consul at Rio.
They must release me,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good. Very good! They must release
you. You are no conspirator—a mere
secretary, and an American.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I nodded, wishing I might share his confidence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Presently he asked for my name
and residence, and I answered him truly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I myself am Manuel Pesta, of the City
of Mexico. You must not forget the name,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>. Manuel Pesta, the clockmaker.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall not forget,” said I, wondering
what he could mean. And a moment later
he startled me by bending forward and asking
in an eager tone:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have they searched you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is my turn soon. This morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He leaned back in his chair, closed his
eyes, and fell silent again.</p>

<p class='c000'>For my part I lay back upon the pillow,
yet taking care to face him, and so we remained
until daylight came and gradually
drove the shadows from the little room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even then my strange companion did not
move. He was indeed a queer mixture of
eager activity and absolute self-repression.
Another hour passed, and then we heard
footsteps approaching down the passageway.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a start Pesta aroused himself and
fixed a searching glance upon my face.
Trembling with nervousness he suddenly
raised his manacled hands and removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>from his mouth a small object that glittered
in the morning light.</p>

<p class='c000'>My heart gave a sudden bound. <em>It was
the ring that opened the secret vault!</em></p>

<p class='c000'>His own agitation prevented his noting
my amazement. Thrusting the ring toward
me he whispered, hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Conceal it, quickly, for the love of God!
Keep it until I come for it—I, Manuel Pesta—until
I demand it of Robert Harcliffe of
New Orleans. It may be to-day—it may
be many days. But I will come, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>, I—”</p>

<p class='c000'>The bolts of the door shot back and a
squad of soldiers entered. Their sudden
appearance barely gave me time to drop the
ring into an outside pocket of my coat. As
two of the soldiers seized him I noticed that
the Mexican was trembling violently; but
he arose meekly and submitted to be led
from the room. Two others motioned me
to follow, and in a few moments we were
ushered into the room where I had had my
interview with the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour was standing by the fireplace
when we entered, and eyeing the Mexican
with indifference he said to the captain:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“This is the man you found secreted in
the out-building?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is, senhor,” answered the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you searched him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only partially. We took from him
this revolver, a knife, and this purse. There
were no papers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour took the weapons in his hands
and examined them. The revolver, I could
see as he threw back the barrel, was loaded
in all six chambers. The knife he glanced
at and turned to place upon the mantel when
a second thought seemingly induced him to
open the blades. It was a large, two-bladed
affair, and the bright steel showed that it
was sharpened as finely as a razor. As I
watched the Emperor’s spy I chanced to
look toward the Mexican and surprised an
expression that nearly resembled terror upon
his haggard face. Perhaps Valcour saw it,
too, for he drew a handkerchief from his
pocket and carefully wiped out the seats in
the handles where the blades lay when the
knife was closed. A small stain appeared
upon the linen, and the spy carried the handkerchief
to the window and inspected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>stain with interest. While he was thus engaged
the Emperor entered the room, followed
by his ministers, and seating himself
at the table calmly proceeded to light a
cigar. Evidently he had just breakfasted,
for he had an appearance of content that
indicated a comfortable condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour, returning from the window, first
saluted the Emperor with great deference,
and then addressed the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you kill that man last evening
and sever his hand with your knife?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mexican gazed at him in horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I—<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>, as God hears me, I—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me why!” said Valcour calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow glared at him as if fascinated.
Then he threw his hands, all manacled as
they were, high above his head, and with a
scream that caused even the Emperor to
start, fell upon the floor in a swoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour turned him over with his foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Search him!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men were thorough. Not a shred of
clothing escaped their eyes. And after they
had finished the detective himself made an
examination.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Dom Pedro was evidently much interested.
Without any explanation further
than Valcour’s accusation, all present understood
that the Mexican was charged with
the murder of the man found in the shrubbery
and therefore he must either have the
ring upon his person or had deposited it in
some secret place.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lay unconscious after the search had
ended, and Valcour, after a moment’s reflection,
ordered the men to carry him back
to the room where he had passed the night,
to guard him well, and to send for a physician.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor relighted his cigar, which
had gone out, and in the interval I heard
the sound of a troupe of horse galloping up
the drive. There was no mistaking the
clank of sabers, and Dom Pedro leaned forward
with an expectant look upon his face,
in which the others joined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the door burst open and a man
entered and knelt before the Emperor. I
could scarcely restrain a cry of surprise as I
saw him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Francisco Paola.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>A DANGEROUS MOMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Not since I parted with him in the road
on the morning of Dom Miguel’s murder
had I seen Paola or heard from him directly.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time, after giving me two men
who had proved faithful both to me and the
Cause, he had ridden on to the house of
death—“to breakfast with his sister.” From
that moment his actions had been a mystery
not only to me but to all his fellow-conspirators.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now it seemed easy to understand
that the Minister of Police had been attending
to the Emperor’s business, and that he
had also been playing a double game from
the beginning, and promoting the revolution
that he might the more easily crush it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he rose to his feet after saluting the
Emperor, Paola glanced around the room
and noted my presence. I could not well
disguise the scorn I felt for this treacherous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>fellow, and as he met my eyes he smiled and
twirled his small moustache with a satisfied
air.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” demanded the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All is indeed well, your Majesty,” returned
the minister, lightly. “The leaders
of the conspiracy, with one exception, are
now under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that one?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sanchez Bastro, a coffee-planter with
a ranch near by. He has crossed the border.
But it is unimportant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Mendez?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Imprisoned in the citadel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span lang="	pt" xml:lang="	pt">Barros</span>?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is comforting Mendez, in the same
cell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Treverot?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unfortunately we were obliged to shoot
him. He chose to resist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hm! And Piexoto?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is below, under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have him brought here.” The captain
left the room, and again the Emperor turned
to Paola.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have done well, senhor; and your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>reward shall be adequate. It was a far-reaching
plot, and dangerous.” And Dom
Pedro sighed as if greatly relieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola brushed a speck of dust from his
sleeve and laughed in his silly fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The serpent is only dangerous, your
Majesty, until its fangs are pulled,” he
drawled, and strolled away toward Valcour,
while the soldiers brought in Senhor Floriano
Piexoto.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous patriot was not only hand-cuffed,
but his elbows were bound together
by cords across his back. But despite his
bonds he walked proudly and scowled into
Dom Pedro’s face as he confronted him.
Indeed, I was filled with admiration to find
that this man whom Fonseca had called
“croaker” could be brave when occasion
demanded it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So, my clever statesman has seen fit to
turn traitor,” began the Emperor, sternly
regarding the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A champion of Liberty must needs be a
traitor to Dom Pedro,” replied Piexoto,
with equal sternness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the conspiracy is at an end, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>am inclined to be merciful,” resumed the
Emperor. “I am told you were the trusted
friend of Miguel de Pintra, and knew his
secrets. If you will inform us how to unlock
the secret vault, I will promise to regard
your offense lightly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Piexoto stared at him a moment indignantly.
Then he turned with a frown upon
Paola.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ask of your Minister of Police,” he retorted;
“for there stands a double traitor!
It was he who stood closest to de Pintra,
winning his confidence only to betray it.
It was Francisco Paola who planned the
secret vault. Who should know better than
he how to open it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor turned to Paola with suspicion
written visibly upon his stern features.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you plan the vault?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Truly, your Majesty. Otherwise the
records would have been scattered in many
places. I planned the vault that all might
be concentrated in one place—where we
should find them when we were ready to explode
the conspiracy. Records—plans—money—all
are now at our hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“But we have not the key. Why did
you plan so complicated a lock?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing else would have satisfied de
Pintra. As for the lock, it is nothing. A
drill through one of the steel panels would
have admitted us easily. But—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what, sir? Why do we not drill
now, instead of seeking this cursed ring?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Minister smiled and again twirled
his moustaches.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because Dom Miguel suddenly developed
inventive genius on his own part. I
was absent when the work was completed,
and too late I discovered that de Pintra had
made pockets everywhere between the steel
plates, and filled every pocket with nitro-glycerine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is all. To drill into the vault is
to explode a pocket of nitro-glycerine, which
in turn will explode all the other pockets
through concussion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And then the contents of the vault would
be blown to atoms. Of the mansion itself
not one stone would remain upon another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>The records we seek would be lost irrevocably.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour, pale with fear, uttered a cry and
dashed through the door, while the Emperor
rose to his feet with a look of terror upon his
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are drilling now!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Silently we stood, none daring to move;
and into our drawn faces Piexoto gazed with
a grim and derisive smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paolo, more composed than any of the
others, except Piexoto, began rolling a cigarette,
but remembering the Emperor’s presence
he ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so we stood, motionless and silent,
until footsteps were again heard and Valcour
re-entered wiping the perspiration from his
forehead with an embroidered handkerchief.
His face wore a look of relief, but there was
a slight tremor in his voice as he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have ordered the drilling stopped,
your Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Pedro, thus reassured, strode back
and forth in evident perplexity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must have the key!” he said, angrily.
“There is no other way. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>key cannot be far off. Has your prisoner,
the Mexican, recovered?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will go and see,” answered the detective,
and again left the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>I caught a look of surprise upon the face
of the Minister of Police. It was fleeting,
but I was sure it had been there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I inquire who this prisoner is?”
he asked. One of the men who acted as
secretary to the Emperor, receiving a nod
from Dom Pedro, informed Paola of the
finding of the dead body in the shrubbery,
and of the consequent arrest of the Mexican.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the key was not found in his possession?”
he inquired, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then he secreted it, fearing arrest.
Have the out-buildings been searched?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let it be done at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour, entering in time to hear this,
flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my business, Senhor Paola. I
will brook no interference from the police.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! had it not been for the police,
Senhor Valcour would have blown his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Emperor into eternity,” returned Paola,
smiling blandly into the spy’s disturbed
countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enough of this!” cried the Emperor.
“Let the grounds and out-buildings be carefully
searched. Is your prisoner recovered,
Valcour?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is raving mad,” returned the detective,
in a surly tone. “It requires two
soldiers to control him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I breathed a sigh of relief, for I had feared
the Mexican, in his terror, would betray the
fact that he had given me the ring.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>TRAITOR TO THE CAUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Emperor retired while the search
of the grounds was being conducted, and
Piexoto and I were escorted to another room
upon the ground floor and locked in. There
were two unbarred windows looking upon
the grounds, but a sentry was posted at each
of these, and as we were still hand-cuffed,
our escape was impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time my companion did nothing
but curse Paola in the most hearty and diversified
manner, and I made no effort to
stop him. But finally this amusement
grew monotonous even to its author, and he
asked me how I had allowed myself to be
captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>I therefore related my adventures, but
said nothing about the ring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have always suspected Paola,” he told
me, “and often warned Dom Miguel against
him. The man’s very nature is frivolous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>He could not be expected to keep faith.
Yet it is surprising he did not choose to
betray the Emperor, rather than us; for
the Revolution is too powerful and too far
advanced to be quelled by the arrest of a few
of its leaders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what of Fonseca?” I asked curiously.
“Why was he not arrested also? Why
was not his name mentioned to the Emperor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I confess the fact puzzles me,” returned
Piexoto, thoughtfully. “Fonseca is even
more compromised than I am myself, and
unless he had a secret understanding with
Paola, and purchased immunity, I cannot
account for his escaping arrest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the general will not forsake the
cause, I am sure,” I said, earnestly. “And
it seems that Senhor Bastro, also, has succeeded
in eluding arrest. Therefore, should
the royalists fail to find the key to the vault,
all may yet be well, in spite of Paola’s
treachery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is another perplexing matter,”
returned Piexoto, pacing the room in deep
thought. “Miguel de Pintra never told me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the vault was sheathed with nitro-glycerine.
Did you know it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” I answered. “But the secret
was revealed to me by Lesba Paola, the
Minister’s sister.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can scarcely believe it, nevertheless,”
he resumed. “Yet what object could the
traitor have in preventing their reaching the
records, unless he knew the attempt to drill
through the walls would destroy us all—himself
included?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps he has fear that the records
would incriminate him with the Emperor,”
I suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bah! He has made his terms, evidently.
That he worked faithfully in our interests
for a time is quite believable; but
either the Emperor’s bribes were too tempting
or he lost faith in the Cause.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I was about to reply when the door
opened to admit Paola. Piexoto paused in
his walk to glare at the Minister, and I
was myself no less surprised at the inopportune
visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Paola, with the old, smirking smile
upon his face that nothing ever seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>banish, nodded pleasantly at us and sat
down in an easy-chair. He rolled a cigarette
and carefully lighted it before he addressed
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Senhors, you are about to denounce
me as a traitor to the Cause,” said he; “but
you may both spare your words. Before
the Cause existed I was Minister to the Emperor.
A policeman walks in devious paths.
If I am true to the oath I gave the Emperor,
how dare you, Floriano Piexoto, who have
violated yours, condemn me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t,” answered the other. “It is
absurd to condemn a man like you. Treachery
is written on every line of your false face.
My only regret is that I did not kill you long
ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet the chief, Dom Miguel de Pintra,
trusted me,” remarked Paola, in a musing
tone, at the same time flicking the ash from
his cigarette with a deliberate gesture. “He
was, it seems, the only one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not so,” said I, angry at his insolent
bearing. “Your sister, sir, had faith in you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at me with a quizzical expression,
and laughed. I had ventured the remark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>in an endeavor to pierce his shield of
conceit and indifference. But it seemed
that even Lesba’s misplaced confidence
failed to shame him, for at that moment
the girl’s loyalty to the Cause seemed to me
beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My sister was, I believe, an ardent republican.
Poor little girl! How could she
judge the merits of a political controversy?
But there, senhors, let us have done with
chidings. I am come for the key.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Piexoto and I stared at each other aghast.
The key! Could the Minister suspect either
of us of possessing it?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quite prettily acted, gentlemen,” he
resumed, “but it is useless to oppose my
request. I suppose our friend Harcliffe has
passed it on to you, senhor? No? Then
he must have it on his person.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you mad?” I asked, with well-assumed
contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; but the Mexican is. I have just
left his room, and he raves perpetually of a
ring he has given to Robert Harcliffe, of
New Orleans. A ring that must be restored
to him on demand.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“He raves,” said I, coolly, although my
heart was beating wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He does, indeed,” acknowledged Paola.
“And he tells exactly where the ring was
placed—in the outer pocket of your jacket.
Will you pardon me, senhor, if I prove the
truth of his assertion?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose and advanced to me with a soft,
stealthy tread, and I backed away until I
stood fairly against the wall, vainly endeavoring
to find some way to circumvent him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold!” cried a clear voice, and as
Paola swung around upon his heel I saw
beyond him the form of Valcour outlined by
the dark doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were doubtless about to search the
prisoner, senhor,” said the spy, calmly, as
he approached us. “I have myself just
come from the Mexican’s room and heard
his ravings. But the task must be mine,
since the Emperor has placed the search for
the key in my hands.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola turned with a slight shrug and resumed
his seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have searched the prisoner already,”
he announced, “but failed to find the ring.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Doubtless he has passed it to Piexoto, or
secreted it. Or, it may be, the Mexican’s
words are mere ravings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The detective hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is this Mexican, Senhor Paola?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frankly, I do not know. Not a conspirator,
I am sure, and evidently not a
royalist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then how came he to know of the existence
of the ring?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A mystery, my dear Valcour. Have
you yet identified the man this Mexican
murdered?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I myself have not had a good look at
the body. If you will take me to him I will
endeavor to locate the fellow. It was
doubtless he who murdered Madam Izabel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke he rose and walked quietly
toward the door, as if he expected Valcour
to follow. But the spy, suddenly suspicious,
cast a shrewd glance at me and replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“One moment, Senhor Paola. I must
satisfy myself that neither Harcliffe nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Piexoto has the ring, in order that I may
report to the Emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As you like,” returned the Minister,
indifferently, and resumed his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour came straight to my side, thrust
his hand within my pocket, and drew out the
ring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” he cried, his face lighting with
joy, “your search must have been a careless
one, my dear Paola! Here is news for the
Emperor, at last.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He hurried from the room, and Paola,
still smiling, rose and faced us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a great pity,” said he, pleasantly,
with his eyes on my face, “that God permits
any man to be a fool.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I could reply he had followed
Valcour from the room, and Piexoto, regarding
me with a sullen frown, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can say amen to that! Why did you
not tell me you had the ring?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I did not reply. The taunts and the loss
of the ring had dazed me and I sank into
a chair and covered my eyes with my
hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pacing the room with furious energy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Piexoto growled a string of laments and reproaches
into my unwilling ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My poor comrades! It is their death-warrant.
These records will condemn to
punishment half the great families of Brazil.
And now when the battle is almost
won, to have them fall into the Emperor’s
hands. Thank God, de Pintra is dead!
This blow would be worse to him than
death itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“However,” said I, somewhat recovering
myself, “we shall now secure his body from
that grim vault. That is one satisfaction,
at least.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not see fit to reply to this, but
paced the floor in as great agitation as before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain de Souza entered with two of his
guards.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Emperor commands you to unlock
the vault,” he said to me. “Be good enough
to follow, senhor. And Senhor Piexoto is
also requested to be present.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell the Emperor I refuse to unlock the
vault,” I returned, firmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why?” demanded Piexoto, scornfully.
“It is merely a question of time, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>that they have the key, when they will find
the right indentation in the door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“True,” I answered. Then, to the captain:
“Lead on, I will follow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They escorted us to the library and down
the winding stair until we stood in the well-known
chamber at the end of the passage.
The outer door of the vault lay open, displaying
the steel surface of the inner door,
with its countless indentations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor and his secretary, together
with Paola and Valcour, were awaiting us.
The latter handed me the ring.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His Majesty commands you to open the
door, senhor Americano,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe the Minister of Police designed
this vault. Let him open it himself,” I replied,
my resolution halting at the thought
of what the open door would reveal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I designed it,” said the Minister,
“but I did not execute the work. Doubtless
in time I could open the door; but the Emperor
is impatient.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw that further resistance was useless.
Bending over, I fitted the stone of the ring
into the proper indentation, and shot the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>bolts. The great door was swung upward,
a whiff of the damp, confined air entered
my nostrils and made me shiver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching my hand within the vault I
turned the switch that threw on the electric
light, and then withdrew that the others
might enter.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no one moved. The light illuminated
the full interior of the great vault, and
every eye gazed eagerly within.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour uttered a groan of baffled rage;
Piexoto swore horribly in a scarcely audible
tone, and the Minister of Police laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good God!” cried the Emperor, with
staring eyeballs, “<em>the vault is empty</em>!”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <span class='large'>THE TORCH OF REBELLION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With a bound I stood within the grim
vault and searched its confines with anxious
eyes. True enough, the place was empty.
Not a scrap of paper, a book, or a bank-note
had been left there. The shelves that lined
the walls were as bare as Mother Hubbard’s
cupboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The records of the Revolution were gone.
The body of Miguel de Pintra was gone.
Thank God, the great and glorious Cause
was as yet safe!</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour was on his hands and knees,
prying into the corners for some scrap that
might have been overlooked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola stood beside me with the old aggravating
simper upon his face, twirling one
end of his moustache.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Valcour stood up and faced
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Traitor!” he cried, with a passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>gesture, “it is you who have done this! It
is you who have led us here only to humiliate
us and laugh at us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your Majesty,” said Paola, without
moving his head, “will you kindly protect
me from the insults of your servants?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have peace, Valcour!” growled the
Emperor. “Senhor Francisco has proved
his loyalty, and doubtless shares our chagrin.
Come, gentlemen, let us leave this
dismal place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I followed slowly in the train of the party
as it wound its way through the narrow passage
and up the iron stairs into the library.
My hand-cuffs had been removed when I
was brought to open the vault, and an idea
came to me to lag behind and try to effect
my escape from the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Valcour was waiting for me at the
trap door, and called Captain de Souza to
guard me. I was taken to the large room
on the ground floor, from whence they had
brought me, thrust through the doorway,
and the key turned upon me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Piexoto had been taken elsewhere, and I
found myself alone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>My thoughts were naturally confused by
the amazing discovery we had just made,
and I was so engaged in wondering what
had become of Dom Miguel and the records
that I scarcely looked up when the door
opened to admit Francisco Paola.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had in his hand a small parcel that
looked like a box, which he placed upon a
table near the open window.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next he drew a note-book from his pocket,
scribbled some lines upon three several
leaves, and then, tearing them out, he reached
within the box, taking care to lift but a
portion of the cover, and busied himself
some moments in a way that made me wonder
what he could be doing. I had no suspicion
of the truth until he carried the box
to the window and quickly removed the
cover. Then, although his back was toward
me, I heard a rapid flutter of wings, followed
by a strange silence, and I knew that Paola
was following with his eyes the flight of the
birds he had liberated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So, my dear Minister, I have at last
discovered your secret!” said a sharp voice,
and as Paola whirled about I noted that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Valcour had entered the room and was
standing with folded arms and eyes that
sparkled triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Orders to my men,” remarked the
Minister, quietly, and brushed a small
feather from his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True enough!” retorted Valcour, with a
bitter smile. “Orders to General Fonseca,
whom you strangely overlooked in making
your decoy arrests. Orders to Sanchez Bastro,
who is to distribute arms to the rebels!
And where did the third pigeon go, my loyal
and conscientious Minister of Police? To
Mazanovitch, or to that Miguel de Pintra
whom you falsely led us to believe had perished
in yonder vault?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He came close to the Minister.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Traitor! In setting free these birds
you have fired the torch of rebellion; that
terrible flame which is liable to sweep the
land, and consume royalist and republican
alike!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola, the sneering smile for once gone
from his face, gazed at his accuser with
evident admiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are wonderfully clever, my dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Valcour,” said he, slowly. “You have wit;
you have a clear judgment; your equal is
not in all Brazil. What a pity, my friend,
that you are not one of us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow, the words seemed to ring true.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour flushed to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hate you,” he cried, stamping his foot
with passion. “You have thwarted me
always. You have laughed at me—sneered
at me—defied me! But at last I have you
in the toils. Francisco Paola, I arrest you
in the name of the Emperor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On what charge?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The charge of treason!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola laughed softly, and in a tone denoting
genuine amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, my brave detective,” said he;
“we will go to the Emperor together, and
accuse each other to our hearts’ content!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He attempted to take Valcour’s arm, in
his inimitable jaunty fashion; but the spy
shook him off and followed Paola from the
room, trembling with suppressed rage.</p>

<p class='c000'>For my part, I knew not what to make
of the scene, except that these men were bitter
enemies, and each endeavoring to destroy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the other. But could Valcour’s accusation
be true? Had the torch of revolution really
been fired?</p>

<p class='c000'>God forbid that I should ever meet with
such another man as Francisco Paola again!
Deep or shallow, coxcomb or clever conspirator,
true man or traitor—it was as impossible
to read him or to judge his real
character as to solve the mighty, unfathomable
secrets of Nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>One moment I called him traitor; the
next I was sure he was faithful to the Cause.
But who could judge the man aright? Not
I, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus reflecting, I approached the window
and looked out. Eight feet below me
one of the Uruguayan guards paced back
and forth upon the green lawn, his short
carbine underneath his arm, and a poniard
swinging at his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow looked up and saw me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Close that window!” he commanded,
with a scowl.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed, sliding the sash to its place.
But still I gazed through the glass at the
labyrinth of walks and hedges defining the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>extensive gardens at this side of the house.
I knew every inch of these grounds, having
wandered there many hours during my sojourn
at the mansion. And the thought
came to me that it would not be difficult to
escape in that maze of hedge and shrubbery,
had I once a fair start of my pursuers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within my range of vision was a portion
of the driveway, and presently I saw the
Emperor’s carriage roll away, followed by
several others. Piexoto was seated in the
last of the carriages, but only a small portion
of the Uruguayan guard accompanied the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to see if the Minister of Police was
among those who were returning to Rio, but
was unable to note his presence in the brief
time the carriages were in view. Nor did
Valcour seem to be with them. Captain de
Souza evidently remained in charge of the
guards left at the mansion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I longed to leave the place myself,
now that the emptiness of the secret vault
had been disclosed; but for some reason
my captors desired me to remain a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day dragged wearily away. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of the Uruguayans brought me food at noontime,
and I ate with good appetite. The
room grew close, but when I attempted to
raise the window the surly guard outside
presented his carbine, and I respected his
wish to leave the sash lowered.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time I had ample opportunity
to speculate upon the astonishing events
of the morning; but my attempt to solve
the problem of what had become of Dom
Miguel and the records seemed absolutely
futile. That the body of the chief had been
removed by some friendly hand—the same
that had saved the funds and papers—there
was no doubt whatever. But when had
this removal taken place?</p>

<p class='c000'>At one time a fleeting hope animated me
that the vault had been entered in time to
save Dom Miguel from suffocation; but a
little reflection soon caused me to abandon
that notion. Allowing that the slayer of
Madam Izabel had been a patriot, and left
the train at the first station beyond Cruz,
he could not possibly have returned to de
Pintra’s mansion on the swiftest horse within
eight hours of the time my friend had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>entombed alive, and long before that Dom
Miguel would have succumbed to the confined
atmosphere of his prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, none of the conspirators who
knew of the ring or was competent to recognize
it had been on the train at the time of
Izabel de Mar’s death. Therefore the patriot
who finally secured the key to the vault
and saved the records must have obtained
the ring long after any hope of saving the
life of the imprisoned chief had been abandoned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow, it occurred to me that the man
in the shrubbery had not been murdered
by the Mexican, but by some one of our
band who had promptly cleared the vault
and escaped with the contents—even while
the Emperor and his party were in possession
of the house. The ring might have been
dropped during the escape and found by
the Mexican—this being the only plausible
way to account for its being in his possession.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although these speculations were to some
extent a diversion, and served to occupy my
thoughts during my tedious confinement,
there were many details to contradict their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>probability, and I was not at all positive that
I had discovered the right explanation of the
mystery.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must have been near evening when the
door was again opened. This time a man
was thrust into the room and the door
quickly locked upon us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I started from my chair with an exclamation
of dismay. My fellow-prisoner was
the mad Mexican!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The man did not seem to notice my
presence at first. For a time he remained
motionless in the position the guards had
left him, his vacant eyes fixed steadily upon
the opposite wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a long-drawn sigh, his gaze
fell and wandered to the table where stood
the remains of my luncheon. With a wolflike
avidity he pounced upon the tray, eagerly
consuming every scrap that I had left,
and draining a small bottle of wine of the
last dregs it contained.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had finished he still continued
to fumble about the tray, and presently
picked up a large, two-tined steel fork and
examined it with careful attention. They
had brought no knife into the room, and I
had scarcely noticed the fork before; yet
now, as the Mexican held it firmly in his
clinched fist, and passed it to and fro with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>serpent-like motion, I realized with a thrill
of anxiety that it might prove a terrible
weapon in the hands of a desperate man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently my fellow-prisoner had the
same thought, for after a time he concealed
the fork in his bosom, and then turned to
examine the room more carefully. His
first act was to approach the window, and
when he started and shrank away I knew
our ever-vigilant guard had warned him not
to consider that avenue of escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next he swung around and faced the
place where I sat, slightly in the shadow.
The day was drawing to its close, and he had
not noticed me before. A swift motion
toward his breast was followed by a smile,
and he advanced close to me and said, in his
stumbling English:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aha! My American frien’ to which I
gave the ring! It is safe, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>? It is
safe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I nodded, thinking to humor him. Indeed,
I could not determine at that moment
whether the man was still insane or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew a chair to my side and sat
down.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Listen, then, my frien’. Together we
will find riches—riches very great! Why?
Because we Mexicans—Careno and myself—we
build the door of the big vault
under this house. So? They bring us
here blindfold. We work many days on
the big plate with strange device cut in the
steel. Careno was expert. Only one place,
cut with great cunning, shot the bolts in
their sockets. For myself, I am clockmaker
and gem-cutter. They tell me to
cut emerald so it fit the plate, and mount
it in ring. Yes, it was I, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor Americano</span>,
who do that fine work—I, Manuel Pesta!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then they carry us away, blindfold
again, to the border of Uruguay. We do
not know this house—we cannot find it
again ever. So they think. But to make
sure they hire men to assassinate us—to
stab us to the heart in those Uruguay
Mountain. Fine pay for our work—eh,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>? But, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">peste</span>! Careno and I—we
stab our assassins—we escape—we swear
vengeance! For two year we wander in
Brazil—seeking, ever seeking for the house
with the vault.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“How clever they are! But we, are we
not also clever? On a railway train one
day we see a lady with the ring! We cannot
mistake—I made it, and I know my
work. It is key to the big vault! Careno
cannot wait. He sit beside lady and put
his knife in her heart. The train rattle
along and the lady make no noise. But the
ring sticks, so Careno cuts off finger and
puts in pocket. Are we not clever, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">señor</span>?
Now we have ring, but yet know not of the
house with the vault. We keep quiet and
ride on to Rio. There the dead lady is
carried out and all is excitement. She is
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señora</span> Izabel de Mar, daughter of Dom
Miguel de Pintra. She come from her
father’s house at Cuyaba. This we hear
and remember. Then a man they call
Valcour he rush up and cry, ‘Her finger
is gone! The ring—where is the ring?’
Aha! we know now we are right.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So we go away and find out about
Miguel de Pintra—the head of great
rebellion with millions of gold and notes to
pay the soldiers when they fight. Good!
We know now of the vault. We know we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>have key. We know we are now rich!
Careno and I we go to Cuyaba—we find
this house—we hide in the bushes till
night. Then Careno get mad for the
money—he want it all, not half—and he
try to murder me. Ah, well! my pistol
is quicker than his knife, that is all. He
is wearing ring, and it stick like it stick on
lady’s hand. Bah! I cut off Careno’s hand
and carve away the ring. It is simple, is
it not?</p>

<p class='c000'>“But now the soldiers gallop up. The
house is fill with people. So I must wait.
I hide in secret place, but soon they
drag me out and make me prisoner. What!
must I lose all now—millions—millions
of gold—and no Careno to share it? No!
I am still clever. I keep ring in mouth
until I meet you, and I give it to you to
keep. When they search me, there is no
ring.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang up, chuckling and rubbing
his hands together in great delight. He
danced a step or two and then drew the
steel fork from his breast and struck it
fiercely into the table-top, standing silently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>to watch it while the prongs quivered and
came to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am I not clever?” he again asked,
drawing out the fork from the wood and
returning it to his breast. “But I am
generous, too. You shall divide with me.
But not half! I won all from Careno, but
you shall have some—enough to be rich,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor Americano</span>. And now, give me the
ring!”</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time his eyes were glittering with
insanity, and at his abrupt demand I
shifted uneasily in my seat, not knowing
how to reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me the ring!” he repeated, a tone
of menace creeping into his high-pitched
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>I arose and walked toward the window,
getting the table between us. Then I
turned and faced him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have taken the ring from me,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood as if turned to stone, his fierce
eyes fixed upon my own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have opened the vault with it,”
I continued, “and found it bare and empty.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>He gave a shrill scream at this, and
began trembling in every limb.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You lie!” he shouted, wildly. “You
try to cheat me—to get all! And the vault
has millions—millions in gold and notes.
Give me the ring!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I made no reply. To reiterate my
assertion would do no good, and the man
was incompetent to consider the matter
calmly. Indeed, he once more drew that
ugly fork from his breast and, grasping it
as one would a dagger, began creeping
toward me with a stealthy, cat-like tread.</p>

<p class='c000'>I approached the edge of the round
center-table, alert to keep its breadth
between me and my companion. The
Mexican paused opposite me, and whispered
between his clinched teeth:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give it me! Give me the ring!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The guard will be here presently,”
said I, fervently hoping I spoke the truth,
“and he will tell you of the ring. I am
quite sure Senhor Valcour has it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, I am betrayed! You wish to take
all—you and this Valcour! But see, my
Americano—I will kill you. I will kill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>you now, and then you have nothing for
your treachery!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly he edged his way around the
table, menacing me with his strange weapon,
and with my eyes fixed upon his I moved
in the opposite direction, retaining the table
as my shield.</p>

<p class='c000'>First in one direction and then in the
other he moved, swiftly at times, then with
deliberate caution, striving ever to take me
unawares and reach me with his improvised
dagger.</p>

<p class='c000'>This situation could not stand the tension
for long; I realized that sooner or later
the game must have an abrupt ending.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, as I dodged my persistent enemy, I
set my wits working to devise a means of
escape. The window seemed my only hope,
and I had lost all fear of the sentry in the
more terrible danger that confronted me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly I exerted my strength and
thrust the table against the Mexican so
forcibly that he staggered backward. Then
I caught up a chair and after a swing around
my head hurled it toward him like a catapult.
It crushed him to the floor, and e’er
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>he could rise again I had thrown up the
sash of the window and leaped out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortune often favors the desperate. I
alighted full upon the form of the unsuspecting
sentry, bearing him to the ground by
my weight, where we both rolled in the grass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly I regained my feet and darted
away into the flower-garden, seeking to
reach the hedges before my guard could
recover himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over my shoulder I saw him kneeling
and deliberately pointing at me his carbine.
Before he could fire the flying form of the
Mexican descended upon him from the
window. There was a flash and a report,
but the ball went wide its mark, and
instantly the two men were struggling in a
death-grapple upon the lawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Away I ran through the maze of hedge
and shrubbery, threading the well-known
paths unerringly. I heard excited shouts
as the guardsmen, aroused by their comrade’s
shot, poured from the mansion and
plunged into the gardens to follow me.
But it was dusk by this time, and I had
little fear of being overtaken.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The estate was bounded upon this side
by an impenetrable thick-set hedge, but it
was broken in one place by a gardeners’
tool-house, which had a door at each side,
and thus admitted one into a lane that
wound through a grove and joined the
main highway a mile beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching this tool-house I dashed within,
closed and barred the door behind me, and
then emerged upon the lane.</p>

<p class='c000'>To my surprise I saw a covered carriage
standing in the gloom, and made out that
the door stood open and a man upon the
box was holding the reins and leaning
toward me eagerly as if striving to solve my
identity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without hesitation I sprang into the carriage
and closed the door, crying to the man:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quick! for your life—drive on!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without a word he lashed his horses and
we started with a jerk that threw me into the
back seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>I heard an exclamation in a woman’s
startled voice and felt a muffled form
shrinking into the corner of the carriage.
Then two shots rang out; I heard a scream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and the sound of a fall as the driver pitched
upon the ground, and now like the wind
the maddened horses rushed on without
guidance, swaying the carriage from side
to side with a dangerous motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Brazilian carriages have a trap
in the top to permit the occupants to
speak to the driver. I found this trap,
threw it upward, and drew myself up until
I was able to scramble into the vacant seat.
The reins had fallen between the horses,
evidently, but we were now dashing through
the grove, and the shadows were so deep
that I could distinguish nothing distinctly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cautiously I let myself down until my
feet touched the pole, and then, resting my
hands upon the loins of the madly galloping
animals, I succeeded in grasping the reins
and returned safely to the box seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then I braced myself to conquer the
runaways, and when we emerged from the
grove and came upon the highway there
was sufficient light for me to keep the
horses in the straight road until they had
tired themselves sufficiently to be brought
under control.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>During this time I had turned to speak
a reassuring word, now and then, to the
unknown woman in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Doubtless she had been both amazed
and indignant at my abrupt seizure of her
equipage; but there was not yet time to
explain to her my necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were headed straight for the station
at Cuyaba, and I decided at once to send
a telegram warning Mazanovitch of danger.
For Paola had turned traitor, the vault
had been opened, and the Emperor was
even now on his way to Rio to arrest all
who had previously escaped the net of the
Minister of Police.</p>

<p class='c000'>So we presently dashed up to the station,
which was nearly deserted at this hour, and
after calling a porter to hold the horses
I went into the station to write my telegram.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mazanovitch had asked me to use but
one word, and although I had much of
interest to communicate, a moment’s thought
assured me that a warning of danger was
sufficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, after a brief hesitation, I wrote the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>word “Lesba,” and handed the message
to the operator.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my name, senhor,” said a
soft voice behind me, and I turned to confront
Lesba Paola.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <span class='large'>THE WAYSIDE INN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Astonishment rendered me speechless,
and at first I could do no more than bow
with an embarrassed air to the cloaked
figure before me. Lesba’s fair face, peering
from beneath her mantilla, was grave but
set, and her brilliant eyes bore a questioning
and half-contemptuous look that was hard
to meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my name, senhor,” she repeated,
“and you will oblige me by explaining
why you are sending it to Captain
Mazanovitch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it your carriage in which I escaped?”
I inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes; and my man now lies wounded
by the roadside. Why did you take me
by surprise, Senhor Harcliffe? And why—<em>why</em>
are you telegraphing my name to
Mazanovitch?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Although my thoughts were somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>confused I remembered that Lesba had
accompanied her brother to Rio; that her
brother had turned traitor, and she herself
had ridden in the Emperor’s carriage, with
the spy Valcour. And I wondered how it
was that her carriage should have been
standing this very evening at a retired spot,
evidently awaiting some one, when I chanced
upon it in my extremity.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is well to take time to consider, when
events are of a confusing nature. In that
way thoughts are sometimes untangled.
Now, in a flash, the truth came to me.
Valcour was still at the mansion—Valcour,
her accomplice; perhaps her lover.</p>

<p class='c000'>To realize this evident fact of her
intrigue with my brilliant foe sent a shiver
through me—a shiver of despair and utter
weariness. Still keeping my gaze upon the
floor, and noting, half-consciously, the click-click
of the telegraph instrument, I said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me, donzella, for using your
carriage to effect my escape. You see,
I have not made an alliance with the royalists,
as yet, and my condition is somewhat
dangerous. As for the use of your name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>in my telegram, I have no objection to
telling you—now that the message has
been sent—that it was a cypher word warning
my republican friends of treachery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you suspect <em>me</em> of treachery, Senhor
Harcliffe?” she asked in cold, scornful tones.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked up, but dropped my eyes again
as I confronted the blaze of indignation
that flashed from her own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I make no accusations, donzella. What
is it to me if you Brazilians fight among
yourselves for freedom or the Emperor, as
it may suit your fancy? I came here to
oblige a friend of my father’s—the one
true man I have found in all your intrigue-ridden
country. But he, alas! is dead, and
I am powerless to assist farther the cause
he loved. So my mission here is ended,
and I will go back to America.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again I looked up; but this time her
eyes were lowered and her expression was
set and impenetrable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not let us part in anger,” I resumed,
a tremor creeping into my voice in spite
of me—for this girl had been very dear
to my heart. “Let us say we have both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>acted according to the dictates of conscience,
and cherish only memories of the happy
days we have passed together, to comfort
us in future years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She started, with upraised hand and
eager face half turned toward the door. Far
away in the distance I heard the tramp of
many hoofs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are coming, senhor!” called the
man who stood beside the horses—one of
our patriots. “It’s the troop of Uruguayans,
I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pedro, the station-master, ran from his
little office and extinguished the one dim
lamp that swung from the ceiling of the
room in which we stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the darkness that enveloped us Lesba
grasped my arm and whispered “Come!”
dragging me toward the door. A moment
later we were beside the carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mount!” she cried, in a commanding
voice. “I will ride inside. Take the road
to San Tarem. Quick, senhor, as you
value <em>both</em> our lives!”</p>

<p class='c000'>I gathered up the reins as Pedro slammed
tight the carriage door. A crack of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>whip, a shout of encouragement from the
two patriots, and we had dashed away upon
the dim road leading to the wild, unsettled
plains of the North Plateau.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were good horses. It surprised
me to note their mettle and speed, and I
guessed they had been carefully chosen
for the night’s work—an adventure of
which this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span> was scarcely expected.
I could see the road but dimly,
but I gave the horses slack rein and they
sped along at no uncertain pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could no longer hear the hoof-beats
of the guards, and judged that either we
had outdistanced them or the shrewd
Pedro had sent them on a false scent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently the sky brightened, and as
the moon shone clear above us I found that
we were passing through a rough country
that was but sparsely settled. I remembered
to have ridden once in this direction with
Lesba, but not so far; and the surroundings
were therefore strange to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>For an hour I drove steadily on, and
then the girl spoke to me through the open
trap in the roof of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“A mile or so further will bring us to a
fork in the road. Keep to the right,” said she.</p>

<p class='c000'>I returned no answer, although I was
burning to question her of many things. But
time enough for that, I thought, when we
were safely at our journey’s end. Indeed,
Lesba’s mysterious actions—her quick return
from Rio in the wake of the Emperor
and Valcour, her secret rendezvous in the
lane, which I had so suddenly surprised
and interrupted, and her evident desire to
save me from arrest—all this was not only
contradictory to the frank nature of the
girl, but to the suspicions I had formed of
her betrayal of the conspiracy in co-operation
with her treacherous brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The key to the mystery was not mine,
and I could only wait until Lesba chose
to speak and explain her actions.</p>

<p class='c000'>I came to the fork in the road and
turned to the right. The trail—for it had
become little more than that—now skirted
a heavy growth of underbrush that merged
into groves of scattered, stunted trees; and
these in time gradually became more compact
and stalwart until a great Brazilian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>forest threw its black shadow over us.
Noiselessly the carriage rolled over the
beds of moss, which were so thick now that
I could scarcely hear a sound of the horses’
hoofs, and then I discerned a short distance
ahead the outlines of an old, weatherbeaten
house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lesba had her head through the trap and
spoke close to my ear.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop at this place,” said she; “for here
our journey ends.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I pulled up the horses opposite the
dwelling and regarded it somewhat doubtfully.
It had been built a hundred yards
or so from the edge of the dense forest and
seemed utterly deserted. It was a large
house, with walls of baked clay and a
thatched roof, and its neglected appearance
and dreary surroundings gave it a fearsome
look as it stood lifeless and weather-stained
under the rays of the moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is the place inhabited?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must be,” she replied. “Go to the
door, and knock upon it loudly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the horses—who will mind them,
donzella?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Instantly she scrambled through the
trap to the seat beside me and took the
reins in her small hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will look after the horses,” said she.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I climbed down and approached the
door. It was sheltered by a rude porch,
and flanked upon either side by well-worn
benches such as are frequent at wayside
inns.</p>

<p class='c000'>I pounded upon the door and then
paused to listen. The sounds drew a hollow
reverberation from within, but aroused no
other reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Knock again!” called Lesba.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed, but with no better success.
The place seemed uncanny, and I returned
abruptly to the carriage, standing beside
the wheel and gazing up through the
moonlight into the beautiful face the girl
bent over me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lesba,” said I, pleadingly, “what does
all this mean? Why have you brought me
to this strange place?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To save your life,” she answered in a
grave voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how came you to be waiting in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>lane? And who were you waiting for?”
I persisted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By what right do you question me,
Senhor Harcliffe?” she asked, drawing
back so that I could no longer look into her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By no right at all, Lesba. Neither do
I care especially whether you are attached
to the Empire or the Republic, or how
much you indulge in political intrigue,
since that appears to be the chief amusement
of your countrymen. But I love you.
You know it well, although you have never
permitted me tell you so. And loving you
as I do, with all my heart, I am anxious to
untangle this bewildering maze and understand
something of your actions since that
terrible morning when I parted with you
at Dom Miguel’s mansion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed, and the laugh was one of
those quaint flashes of merriment peculiar
to the girl, leaving one in doubt whether to
attribute it to amusement or nervous agitation.
Indeed, where another woman might
weep Lesba would laugh; so that it frequently
puzzled me to comprehend her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Now, however, she surprised me by leaning
over me and saying gently:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will answer your question, Robert.
My brother is at the mansion, and in danger
of his life. I was waiting with the carriage
to assist him to escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how do you know he is in danger?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He sent me word by a carrier-pigeon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To be sure. Yet there is one more
thing that troubles me: why were you in
Rio, riding in the Emperor’s carriage with
the spy Valcour?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is simple, senhor. I went to Rio to
assist in persuading Dom Pedro to visit
the vault.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Knowing it was empty?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Knowing it was empty, and believing
that the Emperor’s absence would enable
Fonseca to strike a blow for freedom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then Fonseca is still faithful to the
Cause?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know of no traitor in our ranks,
Robert, although it seems you have suspected
nearly all of us, at times. But it
grows late and my brother is still in peril.
Will you again rap upon the door?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“It is useless, Lesba.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Try the back door; they may hear you
from there,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'>So I made my way, stumbling over
tangled vines and protruding roots, to the
rear of the house, where the shadows lay
even thicker than in front. I found the
door, and hammered upon it with all my
strength. The noise might have raised
the dead, but as I listened intently there
came not the least footfall to reward me.
For a time I hesitated what to do. From
the grim forest behind me I heard a half-audible
snarl and the bark of a wolf; in
the house an impressive silence reigned
supreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>I drew back, convinced that the place
was uninhabited, and returned around the
corner of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no one here, donzella,” I
began, but stopped short in amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The carriage was gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>“ARISE AND STRIKE!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I sprang to the road and peered eagerly
in every direction. Far away in the distance
could be discerned the dim outlines of
the carriage, flying along the way from
whence we had come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lesba had brought me to this place
only to desert me, and it was not difficult
to realize that she had sent me to the rear
of the house to get me out of the way while
she wheeled the carriage around and dashed
away unheard over the soft moss.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I had ceased to speculate upon
the girl’s erratic actions. Only one thing
seemed clear to me; that she had returned
to rescue her brother from the danger which
threatened him. Why she had assisted me
to escape the soldiery only to leave me in
this wilderness could be accounted for but
by the suggestion that her heart softened
toward one whom she knew had learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to love her during those bright days we had
passed in each other’s society. But that
she loved me in return I dared not even
hope. Her answer to my declaration had
been a laugh, and to me this girl’s heart
was as a sealed book. Moreover, it occurred
to me that Valcour also loved her,
and into his eyes I had seen her gaze as she
never had gazed into mine during our most
friendly intercourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The carriage had vanished long since,
and the night air was chill. I returned to
the porch of the deserted house, and curling
myself up on one of the benches soon sank
into a profound slumber, for the events of
the day had well-nigh exhausted me.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I awoke a rough-looking, bearded
man was bending over me. He wore a
peasant’s dress and carried a gun on his
left arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who are you, senhor,” he demanded,
as my eyes unclosed, “and how came you
here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I arose and stretched myself, considering
who he might be.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you ask?” said I.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“There is war in the land, senhor,” he
responded, quietly, “and every man must
be a friend or a foe to the Republic.” He
doffed his hat with rude devotion at the
word, and added, “Declare yourself, my
friend.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I stared at him thoughtfully. War in
the land, said he! Then the “torch of
rebellion” had really been fired. But by
whom? Could it have been Paola, as
Valcour had claimed? And why? Since
the conspiracy had been unmasked and its
leaders, with the exception of Fonseca,
either scattered or imprisoned? Did the
Minister of Police aim to destroy every one
connected with the Cause by precipitating
an impotent revolt? Or was there a master-hand
directing these seemingly incomprehensible
events?</p>

<p class='c000'>The man was growing suspicious of my
silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come!” said he, abruptly; “you shall
go to Senhor Bastro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And where is that?” I asked, with
interest, for Paola had reported that Bastro
had fled the country.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>My captor did not deign to reply. With
the muzzle of his gun unpleasantly close to
my back he marched me toward the edge
of the forest, which we skirted for a time
in silence. Then the path turned suddenly
into a dense thicket, winding between close-set
trees until, deep within the wood, we
came upon a natural clearing of considerable
extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the center of this space was a large,
low building constructed of logs and roofed
with branches of trees, and surrounding the
entire structure were grouped native Brazilians,
armed with rifles, revolvers, and knives.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men were not uniformed, and their
appearance was anything but military;
nevertheless there was a look upon their
stern faces that warned me they were in
deadly earnest and not to be trifled with.</p>

<p class='c000'>As my intercourse with the republicans
had been confined entirely to a few of their
leaders, I found no familiar face among
these people; so I remained impassive while
my captor pushed me past the guards to a
small doorway placed near a protecting
angle of the building.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Enter!” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>I obeyed, and the next moment stood
before a group of men who were evidently
the officers or leaders of the little band of
armed patriots I had seen without.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” said one, in a deep bass voice,
“it is Senhor Harcliffe, the secretary to
Dom Miguel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I have before mentioned the fact that
whenever the conspirators had visited de
Pintra they remained securely masked, so
that their features were, with a few exceptions,
unknown to me. But the voices were
familiar enough, and the man who had
brought me here had mentioned Sanchez
Bastro’s name; so I had little difficulty in
guessing the identity of the personage who
now addressed me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why are you here, senhor?” he inquired,
with evident anxiety; “and do
you bring us news of the uprising?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know nothing of the uprising except
that your man here,” and I turned to my
guide, “tells me there is war in the land,
and that the Revolution is proclaimed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” returned Bastro, with a grave nod.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Then,” I continued, “I advise you to
lay down your arms at once and return to
your homes before you encounter arrest
and imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The leaders cast upon one another uneasy
looks, and Bastro drew a small paper from
his breast and handed it to me. I recognized
it as one of the leaves from his note-book
which Paola had attached to the
carrier-pigeon, and upon it were scrawled
these words, “Arise and strike!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the signal long since agreed upon
to start the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a laugh I handed back the paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is from Francisco Paola, the traitor,”
I said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Traitor!” they echoed, in an astonished
chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Listen, gentlemen; it is evident you
are ignorant of the events of the last two
days.” And in as few words as possible I
related the occurrences at de Pintra’s
mansion, laying stress upon the arrest of
Piexoto, the perfidy of the Minister of
Police, and the death of Treverot.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not so deeply impressed as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>had expected. The discovery of the empty
vault had aroused no interest whatever, and
they listened quietly and without comment
to my story of Paola’s betrayal of his fellow-conspirators
to the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when I mentioned Treverot’s death
Bastro chose to smile, and indicating a tall
gentleman standing at his left, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Permit me to introduce to you Senhor
Treverot. He will tell you that he still
lives.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then Paola lied?” I exclaimed, somewhat
chagrined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bastro shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have confidence in the Minister
of Police,” said he, calmly. “There is no
doubt but General Fonseca, at Rio, has
before now gained control of the capital,
and that the Revolution is successfully
established. We shall know everything very
soon, for my men have gone to the nearest
telegraph station for news. Meantime, to
guard against any emergency, our patriots
are being armed in readiness for combat,
and, in Matto Grosso at least, the royalists
are powerless to oppose us.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“But the funds—the records! What
will happen if the Emperor seizes them?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Emperor will not seize them,”
returned Bastro, unmoved. “The contents
of the vault are in safe-keeping.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I could question him further a
man sprang through the doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The wires from Rio are cut in every
direction,” said he, in an agitated voice.
“A band of the Uruguayan guards, under
de Souza and Valcour, is galloping over
the country to arrest every patriot they can
find, and our people are hiding themselves
in terror.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Consternation spread over the features
of the little band which a moment before
had deemed itself so secure and powerful.
Bastro turned to pace the earthen floor
with anxious strides, while the others
watched him silently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What of Francisco Paola?” suddenly
asked the leader.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, senhor, he seems to have disappeared,”
replied the scout, with hesitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Disappeared! And why?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Perhaps I can answer that question,
Senhor Bastro,” said a voice behind us,
and turning my head I saw my friend
Pedro, the station-master at Cuyaba, standing
within the doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enter, Pedro,” commanded the leader.
“What news do you bring, and why have
you abandoned your post?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The wires are down,” said the station-master,
“and no train is allowed to leave
Rio since the Emperor reached there at
midnight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you know nothing of what has
transpired at the capital?” asked Bastro.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing, senhor. It was yesterday
morning when the Emperor’s party met the
train at Cuyaba, and I handed him a telegram
from de Lima, the Minister of State.
It read in this way: ‘General Fonseca and
his army have revolted and seized the
palace, the citadel, and all public buildings.
I have called upon every loyal Brazilian to
rally to the support of the Empire. Return
at once. Arrest the traitors Francisco Paola
and his sister. Situation critical.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” cried Bastro, drawing a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>breath, “and what said the Emperor to
that message?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He spoke with his counselors, and
wired this brief reply to de Lima, ‘I am
coming.’ Also he sent a soldier back to
de Pintra’s mansion with orders to arrest
Francisco and Lesba Paola. Then he
boarded the train and instructed the conductor
to proceed to Rio with all possible
haste. And that is all I know, senhor,
save that I called up Rio last evening and
learned that Fonseca was still in control of
the city. At midnight the wires were cut
and nothing further can be learned. Therefore
I came to join you, and if there is a
chance to fight for the Cause I beg that
you will accept my services.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bastro paused in his walk to press the
honest fellow’s hand; then he resumed his
thoughtful pacing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The others whispered among themselves,
and one said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why need we despair, Sanchez Bastro?
Will not Fonseca, once in control, succeed
in holding the city?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surely!” exclaimed the leader. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>is not for him that I fear, but for ourselves.
If the Uruguayans are on our trail we must
disperse our men and scatter over the
country, for the spy Valcour knows, I am
sure, of this rendezvous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they are not hunting you, senhor,”
protested Pedro, “but rather Paola and his
sister, who have managed to escape from
de Pintra’s house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nevertheless, the Uruguayans are liable
to be here at any moment,” returned
Bastro, “and there is nothing to be gained
by facing that devil, de Souza.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He then called his men together in the
clearing, explained to them the situation,
and ordered them to scatter and to secrete
themselves in the edges of the forests and
pick off the Uruguayans with their rifles
whenever occasion offered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If anything of importance transpires,”
he added, “report to me at once at my
house.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without a word of protest his commands
were obeyed. The leaders mounted their
horses and rode away through the numerous
forest paths that led into the clearing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>The men also saluted and disappeared
among the trees, and presently only Bastro,
Pedro, and myself stood in the open space.
“Come with me, Senhor Harcliffe,” said
the leader; “I shall be glad to have you
join me at breakfast. You may follow us,
Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he strode to the edge of the clearing,
pressed aside some bushes, and stepped
into a secret path that led through the
densest portion of the tangled forest. I
followed, and Pedro brought up the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some twenty minutes Bastro guided
us along the path, which might well have
been impassable to a novice, until finally
we emerged from the forest to find the open
country before us, and a small, cozy-looking
dwelling facing us from the opposite
side of a well-defined roadway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bastro led us to a side door, which he
threw open, and then stepped back with a
courteous gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enter, gentlemen,” said he; “you are
welcome to my humble home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I crossed the threshold and came to an
abrupt stop. Something seemed to clutch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>my heart with a grip of iron; my limbs
trembled involuntarily, and my eyes grew
set and staring.</p>

<p class='c000'>For, standing before me, with composed
look and a smile upon his dark face, was
the living form of my lamented friend
Miguel de Pintra!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <span class='large'>ONE MYSTERY SOLVED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Compose yourself, my dear Robert,”
said Dom Miguel, pressing my hands in
both his own. “It is no ghost you see, for—thanks
be to God!—I am still alive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I had no words to answer him. In all
my speculations as to the result of Madam
Izabel’s terrible deed, the fate of the records
and the mysterious opening of the vault
without its key, I never had conceived the
idea that Dom Miguel might have escaped
his doom. And to find him here, not only
alive, but apparently in good health and
still busy with the affairs of the Revolution,
conveyed so vivid a shock to my nerves that
I could but dumbly stare into my old friend’s
kind eyes and try to imagine that I beheld
a reality and not the vision of a disordered
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bastro assisted me by laughing loudly and
giving me a hearty slap across the shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Wake up, Senhor Harcliffe!” said he;
“and hereafter have more faith in Providence
and the luck that follows in the
wake of true patriotism. We could ill
afford to lose our chief at this juncture.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how did it happen?” I gasped,
still filled with wonder. “What earthly
power could have opened that awful vault
when its key was miles and miles away?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The earthly power was wielded by a
very ordinary little woman,” said Dom
Miguel, with his old gentle smile. “When
you rode away from the house on that terrible
morning Lesba came and unlocked my
prison, setting me free.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how?” I demanded, still blindly
groping for the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By means of a duplicate key that she
had constantly carried in her bosom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you know of this key, sir?” I
asked, after a pause, which my companions
courteously forbore to interrupt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did not even suspect its existence,”
replied Dom Miguel. “But it seems that
Francisco Paola, with his usual thoughtfulness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>took an impression in wax of my
ring, without my knowledge, and had an
exact duplicate prepared. I think he foresaw
that an emergency might arise when
another key might be required; but it
would not do to let any one know of his
action, for the mere knowledge that such a
duplicate existed would render us all suspicious
and uneasy. So he kept the matter
secret even from me, and gave the ring into
the keeping of his sister, who was his only
confidante, and whom he had requested me
to accept as an inmate of my household,
under the plea that I am her legal guardian.
This was done in order to have her always
at hand in case the interests of the conspiracy
demanded immediate use of the
duplicate key. That Francisco trusted her
more fully than he has any other living
person is obvious; and that she was worthy
of such trust the girl has fully proved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you were released at once?” I
asked; “and you suffered little from your
confinement?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My anguish was more mental than of
a bodily nature,” Dom Miguel answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>sadly; “but I was free to meet Paola when
he arrived at my house, and to assist him
and Lesba in removing the contents of the
vault to a safer place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why, knowing that his sister held
a duplicate key, did the Minister send me
in chase of the ring Madam Izabel had
stolen?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because it was necessary to keep
the matter from the Emperor until the
records had been removed,” explained de
Pintra. “Indeed, Francisco was on his
way to us that morning to insist upon our
abandoning the vault, after having given
us warning, as you will remember, the night
before, that the clever hiding-place of our
treasure and papers was no longer a secret.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I remember that he himself revealed
the secret to the Emperor,” I remarked,
dryly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And acted wisely in doing so, I have
no doubt,” retorted Bastro, who still stood
beside us. “But come, gentlemen, breakfast
must be ready, and I have a vigorous
appetite. Be good enough to join me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He led the way to an inner room, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>de Pintra and I followed, his arm in
mine.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to me, now that I regarded
him more attentively, that my old friend
was less erect than formerly, that there were
new and deep furrows upon his gentle face,
and that his eyes had grown dim and
sunken. But that the old, dauntless spirit
remained I never doubted.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we entered the breakfast-room I saw
a form standing at the window—the form
of a little man clothed neatly in black. He
turned to greet us with pale, expressionless
features and drooping eyelids.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Captain Mazanovitch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, Senhor Harcliffe,” he
said, in his soft voice; and I wondered how
he had recognized me without seeming to
open his eyes. “And what news does our
noble Captain Bastro bring of the Revolution?”
he continued, with a slight note of
interest in his voice that betrayed his
eagerness.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we breakfasted Bastro related the
events of the morning, and told how the
news he had received of the activity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Uruguayan guards, in connection with the
impossibility of learning from Rio what
Fonseca had accomplished, had induced
him to disband his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But can you again assemble them, if you
should wish to?” inquired Dom Miguel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easily,” answered our host; but he
did not explain how.</p>

<p class='c000'>While he and Dom Miguel discussed the
fortunes of the Revolution I made bold to
ask Captain Mazanovitch how he came to
be in this isolated spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was warned by the Minister of Police
to leave Rio,” answered the detective; “for
it appears my—my friend Valcour would
have been suspicious had not Paola promised
to arrest me with the others. I have
been here since yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your friend Valcour is a most persistent
foe to the Cause,” said I, thoughtfully.
“It would have pleased you to
watch him struggle with Paola for the
mastery, while the Emperor was by. Ah,
how Paola and Valcour hate each other!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mazanovitch turned his passionless face
toward me, and it seemed as though a faint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>smile flickered for an instant around his
mouth. But he made no answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>After breakfast Pedro was sent back to
Cuyaba for news, being instructed to await
there the repairing of the telegraph wires,
and to communicate with us as soon as he
had word from Rio.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man had no sooner disappeared in
the forest than, as we stood in the roadway
looking after him, a far-off patter of horses’
feet was distinctly heard approaching from
the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>Silently we stood, gazing toward the
curve in the road while the hoof-beats grew
louder and louder, till suddenly two horses
swept around the edge of the forest and bore
down upon us.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then to the surprise of all we recognized
the riders to be Francisco Paola and his
sister Lesba, and they rode the same horses
which the evening before had been attached
to the carriage that had brought me from
de Pintra’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they dashed up both brother and
sister sprang from the panting animals, and
the former said, hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Quick, comrades! Into the house and
barricade the doors. The Uruguayans are
upon us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>True enough; now that their own horses
had come to a halt we plainly heard the
galloping of the troop of pursuers. With
a single impulse we ran to the house and
entered, when my first task was to assist
Bastro in placing the shutters over the
windows and securing them with stout
bars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The doors were likewise fastened and
barred, and then Mazanovitch brought us
an armful of rifles and an ample supply of
ammunition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think it wise to resist?” asked
de Pintra, filling with cartridges the magazine
of a rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>A blow upon the door prevented an
answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open, in the name of the Emperor!”
cried an imperious voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my gallant friend Captain de
Souza,” said Lesba, with a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>I looked at the strange girl curiously.
She had seated herself upon a large chest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and with her hands clasped about one knee
was watching us load our weapons with as
much calmness as if no crisis of our fate
was impending.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be kind to him, Lesba,” remarked
Paola, tucking a revolver underneath his
arm while he rolled and lighted a cigarette.
“Think of his grief at being separated from
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed again, with real enjoyment,
and shook the tangled locks of hair from
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps if I accept his attentions he
will marry me, and I shall escape,” she
rejoined, lightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open, I command you!” came the
voice from without.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Really,” said Lesba, looking upon us
brightly, “it was too funny for anything.
Twice this morning the brave captain nearly
succeeded in capturing me. He might
have shot me with ease, but called out that
he could not bear to injure the woman he
loved!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Does he indeed love you, Lesba?”
asked de Pintra, gently.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“So he says, Uncle. But it must have
been a sudden inspiration, for I never saw
him until yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nevertheless, I am glad to learn of
this,” resumed Dom Miguel; “for there
is no disguising the fact that they outnumber
us and are better armed, and it is
good to know that whatever happens to us,
you will be protected.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whatever happens to you will happen
to me,” declared the girl, springing to her
feet. “Give me a gun, Uncle!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now came another summons from de
Souza.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Listen!” he called; “the house is
surrounded and you cannot escape us.
Therefore it will be well for you to surrender
and rely upon the Emperor’s mercy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear we may not rely on that with any
security,” drawled Paola, who had approached
the door. “Pray tell us, my good
de Souza, what are your orders respecting
us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To arrest you at all hazards,” returned
the captain, sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And then?” persisted the Minister,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>leaning against the door and leisurely puffing
his cigarette.</p>

<p class='c000'>But another voice was now heard—Valcour’s—crying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open at once, or we will batter down
the door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before any could reply Mazanovitch
pushed Paola aside and placed his lips to
the keyhole.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hear me, Valcour,” he said, in a soft
yet penetrating tone, “we are able to
defend ourselves until assistance arrives.
But rather than that blood should be shed
without necessity, we will surrender ourselves
if we have your assurance of safe
convoy to Rio.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment there was silence. Then,
“How came <em>you</em> here?” demanded the
spy, in accents that betrayed his agitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That matters little,” returned Mazanovitch.
“Have we your assurance of safety?”</p>

<p class='c000'>We heard the voices of Valcour and de
Souza in angry dispute; then the captain
shouted: “Stand aside!” and there came a
furious blow upon the door that shattered
the panels.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Bastro raised his rifle and fired. A cry
answered the shot, but instantly a second
crash followed. The bars were torn from
their sockets, the splintered door fell inward,
and before we could recover from the
surprise we were looking into the muzzles of
a score of carbines leveled upon us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” said Paola, tossing the
end of his cigarette through the open doorway.
“We are prisoners of war. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Peste</span>!
my dear Captain; how energetic your
soldiers are!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A moment later we were disarmed, and
then, to our surprise, de Souza ordered our
feet and our hands to be securely bound.
Only Lesba escaped this indignity, for the
captain confined her in a small room adjoining
our own and placed a guard at the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time Valcour stood by, sullen
and scowling, his hands clinched nervously
and his lips curling with scorn.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You might gag us, my cautious one,”
said Paola, addressing the officer, who had
planted himself, stern and silent, in the center
of the room while his orders were being
executed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“So I will, Senhor Paola; but in another
fashion,” was the grim reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew a paper from his breast and continued,
“I will read to you my orders from
his Majesty, the Emperor Dom Pedro of
Brazil, dispatched from the station at Cuyaba
as he was departing for his capital to
quell the insurrection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused and slowly unfolded the paper,
while every eye—save that, perhaps, of
Mazanovitch—was fixed upon him with
intent gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘You are instructed to promptly arrest
the traitor Francisco Paola, together with
his sister, Lesba Paola, and whatever revolutionists
you may be able to take, and to
execute them one and all without formal
trial on the same day that they are captured,
as enemies of the Empire and treasonable
conspirators plotting the downfall of the
Government.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain paused a moment, impressively,
and refolded the document.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is signed by his Majesty’s own hand,
and sealed with the royal seal,” he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <span class='large'>THE DEATH SENTENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I glanced around the room to note the
effect of this startling announcement upon
my fellow-prisoners. Bastro’s scowling face
was turned full upon the officer, but showed
no sign of fear. De Pintra smiled rather
scornfully and whispered a word to Mazanovitch,
whose countenance remained impassive
as ever. Paola, with the perpetual
simper distorting his naturally handsome
features, leaned back in his chair and regarded
his trussed ankles with whimsical
indifference. Indeed, if the captain thought
to startle or terrify his captives he must have
been grievously disappointed, for one and
all received the announcement of the death
sentence with admirable composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Valcour who broke the silence.
Confronting the captain with blazing eyes,
while his slight form quivered with excitement,
he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“This is nonsense, de Souza! The Emperor
must have been mad to write such an
order. You will convey your prisoners to
Rio for trial.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall obey the Emperor’s commands,”
answered the captain, gloomily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is murder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the Emperor’s will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hear me, Captain de Souza,” said Valcour,
drawing himself up proudly; “you
were instructed to obey my commands. I
order you to convey the prisoners to Rio,
that they may be tried in a court of
justice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The other shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The order is to me personally, and I
must obey. A soldier never questions the
commands of his superiors.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I am your superior!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not in this affair, Senhor Valcour. And
the Emperor’s order is doubtless to be
obeyed above that of his spy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour winced, and turned away to pace
the floor nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the lady—surely you will not execute
the Donzella Paola in this brutal fashion!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>he protested, after an interval of
silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain flushed, and then grew pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will speak with the lady,” he said,
and motioning aside the guard he entered
the room where Lesba was confined, and
closed the door after him.</p>

<p class='c000'>We could hear his voice through the thin
partition, speaking in low and earnest tones.
Then a burst of merry laughter from Lesba
fell upon our ears with something of a shock,
for the matter seemed serious enough to
insure gravity. Evidently the captain protested,
but the girl’s high-pitched tones and
peals of merriment indicated that she was
amusing herself at his expense, and suddenly
the door burst open and de Souza stumbled
out with a red and angry face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The woman is a fiend!” he snarled.
“Let her die with the others.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour, who had continued to pace the
floor during this interview, had by now
managed to get his nerves under control, for
he smiled at the captain, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us see if I have any argument that
will avail.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>While the officer stood irresolute, Valcour
bowed mockingly, opened the door, and
passed into Lesba’s room.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was de Souza’s turn now to pace the
floor, which he did with slow and measured
strides; but although we strained our ears,
not a sound of the interview that was progressing
reached us through the partition.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a considerable time it seemed that
the captain regretted having allowed Valcour
this privilege, for he advanced to the
door and placed his hand on the knob. Instantly
the spy appeared, closing the door
swiftly behind him and turning the key in
the lock.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I withdraw my opposition, Captain,”
said he. “You may execute the lady with
the others, for all I care. When is the
massacre to take place?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The officer stroked his moustache and
frowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The order commands the execution on
the same day the conspirators are arrested,”
he announced. “I do not like the job, Valcour,
believe me; but the Emperor must be
obeyed. Let them die at sunset.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>He turned abruptly and left the house,
but sent a detachment of the Uruguayans
to remain in the room with us and guard
against any attempt on our part to escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>We indulged in little conversation. Each
had sufficient to occupy his thoughts, and
sunset was not very far away, after all.
To me this ending of the bold conspiracy
was not surprising, for I had often thought
that when Dom Pedro chose to strike he
would strike in a way that would deter all
plotting against the government for some
time to come. And life is of little value in
these South American countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are the records?” I whispered
to Dom Miguel, who sat near me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Safe with Fonseca in Rio,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you imagine that Fonseca will succeed?”
I continued.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He is sure to,” said the chief, a soft
gleam lighting his eyes. “It is only we who
have failed, my friend.” He paused a moment,
and then resumed: “I am sorry I
have brought you to this, Robert. For the
rest of us it matters little that we die. Is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>a free Brazil a glorious prize to be won by
the purchase of a few lives?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was futile to answer. A free Brazil
meant little to me, I reflected; but to die
with Lesba was a bit comforting, after all.
I must steel myself to meet death as bravely
as this girl was sure to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola, after sitting long silent, addressed
Valcour, who, since the captain’s exit, had
been staring from the window that faced the
forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What did de Souza say to Lesba?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spy turned around with a countenance
more composed and cheerful than he
had before shown, and answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“He offered to save her from death if she
would marry him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah; and she laughed at the dear captain,
as we all heard. But you, senhor,
made an effort to induce her to change her
mind—did you not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I?” returned Valcour. “By no means,
senhor. It is better she should die than
marry this brutal Captain de Souza.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This speech seemed to confirm my suspicion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>that Valcour himself loved Lesba.
But Paola cast one of his quick, searching
glances into the spy’s face and seemed
pleased by what he discovered there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I speak with my sister?” he asked,
a moment later.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Impossible, senhor. She must remain
in solitary confinement until the hour of
execution, for the captain’s gallantry will
not permit him to bind her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, approaching de Pintra, Valcour
stood a moment looking down at him and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir, you have made a noble fight for a
cause that has doubtless been very dear to
you. And you have lost. In these last
hours that you are permitted to live will you
not make a confession to your Emperor, and
give him the details of that conspiracy in
which you were engaged?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In Rio,” answered Dom Miguel, quietly,
“there is now no Emperor. The Republic
is proclaimed. Even at this moment
the people of our country are acclaiming the
United States of Brazil. Senhor, your power
is ended. You may, indeed, by your master’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>orders, murder us in this far-away province
before assistance can reach us. But
our friends will exact a terrible vengeance
for the deed, be assured.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour did not answer at once. He
stood for a time with knitted brows, thoughtfully
regarding the white-haired chieftain
of the Republic, whose brave utterances
seemed to us all to be fraught with prophetic
insight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If your lives were in my hands,” said
the spy, with a gesture of weariness, “you
would be tried in a court of justice. I am no
murderer, senhor, and I sincerely grieve that
de Souza should consider his orders positive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned abruptly to Mazanovitch, and
throwing an arm around the little man’s
shoulders bent swiftly down and pressed a
kiss upon the pallid forehead. Then, with
unsteady gait he walked from the room, and
at last I saw the eyes of Mazanovitch open
wide, a gaze of ineffable tenderness following
the retreating form, until Valcour had disappeared.
Paola also was staring, and the
disgusting simper had left his face, for a
time, at least.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Silence now fell upon the room. Bastro,
in his corner, had gone to sleep, and Dom
Miguel seemed lost in thought. From the
chamber in which Lesba was confined came
no sound to denote whether the girl grieved
over her approaching fate or bore it with
the grim stoicism of her doomed comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The guard paced up and down before the
closed door, pausing at times to mutter a
word to his fellows, who stood watchfully
over us. From my station on the chest I
could gaze into the yard and note the shadow
of the house creeping further and further
out into the sunshine, bringing ever nearer
the hour when the bright orb would sink
into the far-away plateau and our eyes would
be closed forever in death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the time dragged wearily, it seemed
to me. When one is condemned to die it
is better to suffer quickly, and have done
with it. To wait, to count the moments, is
horrible. One needs to have nerves of iron
to endure that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, we endured it. The hours
passed, somehow, and the shadows grew dim
with stretching.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Suddenly I heard a clank of spurs as de
Souza approached. He gave a brief order
to the Uruguayans who were lounging in the
yard, and then stepped through the doorway
and faced us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get ready, senhors,” said he. “The
hour has come.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <span class='large'>AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We aroused ourselves, at this, and regarded
the captain attentively.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned his stern gaze upon one after
the other, and gave a growl of satisfaction
as he noted no craven amongst us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall draw cuts, gentlemen, to decide
the order in which you must expiate
your crime. I will show no partiality. See,
here are the slips, a number written upon
each. Julio shall place them in his hat and
allow you to draw.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He handed the bits of paper to one of his
men and strode to the door of Lesba’s room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open!” he commanded, giving it a rap
with his knuckles.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Open!” said he, again, and placed his
ear to the panel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with a sudden gesture, he swung
the door inward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>A moment the officer stood motionless,
gazing into the chamber. Then he turned
to us a face convulsed with anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who permitted the woman to escape?”
he demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The guards, startled and amazed, peered
over his shoulders into the vacant room; but
none dared to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What now, Captain, has your bird
flown?” came Valcour’s soft voice, and the
spy entered the room and threw himself
carelessly into a chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Souza looked upon his colleague with
evident suspicion, and twisted the ends of
his moustache in sullen fury. Perhaps he
dared not accuse Valcour openly, as the
latter was the Emperor’s authorized representative.
And it may be the captain was
not sincerely sorry that Lesba had escaped,
and so saved him from the necessity of executing
her, for, after a period of indecision,
the wrath of the officer seemed to cool,
and he slowly regained his composure. Valcour,
who was watching him, appeared to
notice this, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You forgot the window, my Captain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>It was not difficult for the senhorita to steal
across the roadway unobserved and take
refuge in the forest. For my part, I am
glad she is gone. Our royal master has
little credit in condemning a woman to such
a death.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have a care, senhor! Your words are
treasonable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Emperor will be the first to applaud
them, when he has time to think. Indeed,
de Souza, were I in your place, I should
ignore the order to execute these people.
His Majesty acted under a severe nervous
strain, and he will not thank you, believe me,
for carrying out his instructions so literally.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A soldier’s duty is to obey,” returned
the officer, stiffly. Then, turning to the tall
Uruguayan who held the hat, he added:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let the prisoners draw, Julio!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another soldier now unfastened our
bonds, and Paola, who was the first to be
approached by Julio, took a slip of paper
from the hat and thrust it into his pocket
without examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sanchez Bastro drew next, and smiled
as he read his number. Then came my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>turn, and I own that I could not repress a
slight trembling of my fingers as I drew
forth the fatal slip. It was number four.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” murmured de Pintra, reading
the slip over my shoulder. “I shall not be
alive to witness your death, Robert.” And
then he took the last paper from the hat
and added: “I am number two.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am first,” said Bastro, with cheerfulness.
“It is an honor, Dom Miguel,” and
he bowed respectfully to the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola wore again the old, inane smile
that always lent his face an indescribable
leer of idiocy. I knew, by this time, that
the expression was indeed a mask to cover
his real feelings, and idly wondered if he
would choose to die with that detestable
simper upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, gentlemen; we are ready.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the captain who spoke, and we
rose obediently and filed through the doorway,
closely guarded by the Uruguayans.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the vacant space that served as a yard
for Bastro’s house stood a solitary date-palm
with a straight, slender trunk. Before this
we halted, and Bastro was led to the tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>and a rope passed around his body securing
him to the trunk. They offered to blindfold
him, but he waved the men aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will please me best to look into the
muzzles of your guns,” said the patriot, in
a quiet voice. “I am not afraid, Senhor
Captain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>De Souza glanced at the sun. It was
slowly sinking, a ball of vivid red, into the
bosom of the far-away plateau.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a gesture from the officer six of the
guardsmen stepped forward and leveled
their carbines upon Bastro, who stood upright
against the tree, with a proud smile
upon his manly face.</p>

<p class='c000'>I turned away my head, feeling sick and
dizzy; and the rattle of carbines set me
trembling with nervous horror. Nor did I
look toward the tree again, although, after
an interval of silence, I heard the tramp of
soldiers bearing Bastro’s body to the deserted
house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Number two!” cried de Souza, harshly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no time to turn craven. My own
death was but a question of moments, and I
realized that I had little time to bid farewell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>to my kind friend and strive to cheer him
upon his way. Going to his side I seized
Dom Miguel’s hand and pressed it to my
lips; but he was not content with that, and
caught me in a warm and affectionate embrace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he was led to the tree. I turned
my back, covering my face with my hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For the Cause!” I heard his gentle voice
say. The carbines rang out again, and
a convulsive sob burst from my throat in
spite of my strong efforts to control my
emotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again I listened to the solemn tread of
the soldiers, while from far away the sound
of a shout was borne to us upon the still
evening air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow, that distant shout thrilled me
with a new-born hope, and I gazed eagerly
along the line of roadway that skirted the
forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Souza was gazing there, too, with a
disturbed look upon his face; but the light
was growing dim, and we could see nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Number three!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Paola’s turn, and he walked unassisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>to the tree and set his back to it,
while the soldiers passed the rope under
his arms and then retired. But they left
Valcour confronting the prisoner, and I saw
the simper fade from Paola’s lips and an
eager gleam light his pale features.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments they stood thus, separated
from all the rest, and exchanging
earnest whispers, while the captain stamped
his foot with savage impatience.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, come, Valcour!” he called, at
last. “You are interfering with my duty.
Leave the prisoner, I command you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The spy turned around, and his face was
positively startling in its expression of intense
agony.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you are in a hurry, my dear Captain,
fire upon us both!” said he, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a muttered oath de Souza strode
forward, and seizing Valcour by the arm,
dragged him back of the firing-line.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at that instant a startling sound
reached our ears—the sound of a cheer—and
with it came the rapid patter of horses’
feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soldiers, who had already leveled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>their guns at Paola, swung suddenly around
upon their heels; de Souza uttered an exclamation
of dismay, and the rest of us stood
as motionless as if turned to stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>For sweeping around the curve of the
forest came a troop of horsemen, led by
a girl whose fluttering white skirts trailed
behind her like a banner borne on the breeze.
God! how they rode—the horses plunging
madly forward at every bound, their red
eyes and distended nostrils bearing evidence
of the wild run that had well-nigh exhausted
their strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the riders, as they sighted us,
screamed curses and encouragement in the
same breath, bearing down upon our silent
group with the speed of a whirlwind.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was little time for the Uruguayans
to recover from their surprise, for at close
range the horsemen let fly a volley from
rifle and revolver that did deadly havoc.
A few saddles were emptied in return, but
almost instantly the soldiers and patriots
were engaged in a desperate hand-to-hand
conflict, with no quarter given or expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Souza fell wounded at the first volley,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and I saw Valcour, with a glad cry, start
forward and run toward Paola, who was
still bound to his tree. But the captain,
half raising himself from the ground, aimed
his revolver at the prisoner, as if determined
upon his death in spite of the promised
rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out!” I shouted, observing the
action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola was, of course, helpless to evade
the bullet; but Valcour, who had nearly
reached him, turned suddenly at my cry
and threw himself in front of Paola just as
the shot rang out.</p>

<p class='c000'>An instant the spy stood motionless.
Then, tossing his arms above his head, he
fell backward and lay still.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>THE EMPEROR’S SPY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Although the deadly conflict was raging
all about us, I passed it by to regard a still
more exciting tragedy. For with a roar like
that from a mad bull Mazanovitch dashed
aside his captors and sprang to the spot
where Valcour lay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my darling, my darling!” he
moaned, raising the delicate form that he
might pillow the head upon his knee.
“How dared they harm you, my precious
one! How dared they!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola, struggling madly with his bonds,
succeeded in bursting them asunder, and
now staggered up to kneel beside Valcour.
His eyes were staring and full of a horror
that his own near approach to death had
never for an instant evoked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking one of the spy’s slender hands in
both his own he pressed it to his heart and
said in trembling tones:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“Look up, sweetheart! Look up, I beg
of you. It is Francisco—do you not know
me? Are you dead, Valcour? Are you dead?”</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentle hand pushed him aside, and
Lesba knelt in his place. With deft fingers
she bared Valcour’s breast, tearing away the
soft linen through which a crimson stain
had already spread, and bending over a
wound in the left shoulder to examine it
closely. Standing beside the little group,
I found myself regarding the actors in this
remarkable drama with an interest almost
equaling their own. The bared breast revealed
nothing to me, however; for already
I knew that Valcour was a woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently Lesba looked up into the little
man’s drawn face and smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fear nothing, Captain Mazanovitch,”
said she softly; “the wound is not very
dangerous, and—please God!—we will yet
save your daughter’s life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His daughter! How much of the mystery
that had puzzled me this simple word
revealed!</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola, still kneeling and covering his face
with his hands, was sobbing like a child;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Mazanovitch drew a long breath and allowed
his lids to again droop slowly over
his eyes; and then Lesba looked up and
our eyes met.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am just in time, Robert,” she murmured
happily, and bent over Valcour to
hide the flush that dyed her sweet face.</p>

<p class='c000'>I started, and looked around me. In
the gathering twilight the forms of the
slaughtered Uruguayans lay revealed where
they had fallen, for not a single member of
Dom Pedro’s band of mercenaries had escaped
the vengeance of the patriots.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those of our rescuers who survived were
standing in a little group near by, leaning
upon their long rifles, awaiting further commands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among them I recognized Pedro, and
beckoning him to follow me I returned to
the house and lifted a door from its hinges.
Between us we bore it to the yard and very
gently placed Valcour’s slight form upon
the improvised stretcher.</p>

<p class='c000'>She moaned at the movement, slowly
unclosing her eyes. It was Paola’s face that
bent over her and Paola that pressed her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>hand; so she smiled and closed her eyes
again, like a tired child.</p>

<p class='c000'>We carried her into the little chamber
from whence Lesba had escaped, for in the
outer room lay side by side the silent forms
of the martyrs of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tenderly placing Valcour upon the couch,
Pedro and I withdrew and closed the door
behind us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had started to pass through the outer
room into the yard when an exclamation
from the station-master arrested me. Turning
back I found that Pedro had knelt beside
Dom Miguel and with broken sobs was
pressing the master’s hand passionately to
his lips. My own heart was heavy with sorrow
as I leaned over the outstretched form
of our beloved chief for a last look into his
still face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even as I did so my pulse gave a bound
of joy. The heavy eyelids trembled—ever
so slightly—the chest expanded in a gentle
sigh, and slowly—oh, so slowly!—the eyes
of Dom Miguel unclosed and gazed upon
us with their accustomed sweetness and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Master! Master!” cried Pedro, bending
over with trembling eagerness, “it is
done! It is done, my master! The Revolution
is accomplished—Fonseca is supreme
in Rio—the army is ours! The country is
ours! God bless the Republic of Brazil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>My own heart swelled at the glad tidings,
now heard for the first time. But over the
face of the martyred chief swept an expression
of joy so ecstatic—so like a dream of
heaven fulfilled—that we scarcely breathed
as we watched the light grow radiant in his
eyes and linger there while an ashen pallor
succeeded the flush upon his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Painfully Dom Miguel reached out his
arms to us, and Pedro and I each clasped a
hand within our own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad,” he whispered, softly. “Glad
and content. God bless the Republic of
Brazil!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The head fell back; the light faded from
his eyes and left them glazed and staring;
a tremor passed through his body, communicating
its agony even to us who held
his hands, as by an electric current.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pedro still kneeled and sobbed, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>contented myself with pressing the hand
and laying it gently upon Dom Miguel’s
breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly it was done, and well done. In
Rio they were cheering the Republic, while
here in this isolated cottage, surrounded
by the only carnage the Revolution had involved,
lay stilled forever that great heart
which had given to its native land the birthright
of Liberty.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Lesba had dressed Valcour’s wound with
surprising skill, and throughout the long,
dreary night she bathed the girl’s hot forehead
and nursed her as tenderly as a sister
might, while Paola sat silently by and
watched her every movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early morning Pedro summoned
us to breakfast, which he had himself prepared;
and, as Valcour was sleeping, Lesba
and Mazanovitch joined me at the table
while Paola still kept ward in the wounded
girl’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The patriots were digging a trench in
which to inter the dead Uruguayans, and
I stood in the doorway a moment and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>watched them, drinking in at the same time
the cool morning air.</p>

<p class='c000'>There Lesba joined me, somewhat pale
from her night’s watching, and although as
yet no word of explanation had passed between
us, she knew that I no longer doubted
her loyalty, and forbore to blame me for
my stupidity in not comprehending that her
every action had been for the welfare of the
Cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>At breakfast Pedro told us more of the
wonderful news; how the Revolution had
succeeded in Rio with practically no bloodshed
or resistance; how Fonseca had met
the Emperor at the train on his arrival and
escorted him, well guarded, to the port,
where he was put on board a ship that sailed
at once for Lisbon. Indeed, that was to be
the last of Dom Pedro’s rule, for the populace
immediately proclaimed Fonseca dictator,
and the patriots’ dream of a Republic
of Brazil had become an established fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently we passed into the outer room
and looked upon the still form of Miguel
de Pintra, the man to whose genius the
new Republic owed its success—the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>leader who had miserably perished on the
very eve of his noble achievement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conspiracy was a conspiracy no
longer; it had attained to the dignity of a
masterly Revolution, and the Cause of Freedom
had once more prevailed!</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking Lesba’s hand we passed the
bodies of Bastro and Captain de Souza and
gained the yard, walking slowly along the
road that skirted the forest, while she told
me how Valcour had assisted her to escape
from the chamber, that she might summon
the patriots to effect our rescue. She had
wandered long in the forest, she explained,
before Pedro met her and assisted her to
gather the band that had saved us. Yet
the brave girl’s grief was intense that she
had not arrived in time to rescue her guardian,
Dom Miguel, whom she so dearly
loved.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet I think, Robert,” said she, with
tearful eyes, “that uncle would have died
willingly had he known the Republic was
assured.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He did know it,” said I. “For a moment,
last evening, he recovered consciousness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>It was but a moment, but long enough
for Pedro to tell him the glorious news of
victory. And he died content, Lesba, although
I know how happy it would have
made him to live to see the triumph of the
new Republic. His compatriots would also
have taken great pride in honoring Dom
Miguel above all men for his faithful service.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She made no reply to this, and for a time
we walked on in gloomy silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me, Lesba, have you long had
knowledge of Valcour’s real identity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Francisco told me the truth months ago,
and that he loved her,” she replied. “But
Valcour was sworn to the Emperor’s service,
and would not listen to my brother as long
as she suspected him of being in league with
the Republicans. So they schemed and
struggled against one another for the supremacy,
while each admired the other’s
talents, and doubtless longed for the warfare
to cease.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how came this girl to be the Emperor’s
spy, masquerading under the guise
of a man?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“She is the daughter of Captain Mazanovitch,
who, when her mother died, took
delight in instructing his child in all the arts
known to the detective police. As she grew
up she became of great service to her father,
being often employed upon missions of extreme
delicacy and even danger. Mazanovitch
used to boast that she was a better
detective than himself, and the Emperor
became attached to the girl and made her
his confidential body-guard, sending her at
times upon important secret missions connected
with the government. When Mazanovitch
was won over to the Republican
conspiracy his daughter, whose real name
is Carlotta, refused to desert the Emperor,
and from that time on treated her father as
a traitor, and opposed her wit to his own on
every occasion. The male attire she wore
both for convenience and as a disguise; but
I have learned to know Valcour well, and
have found her exceedingly sweet and
womanly, despite her professional calling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all simple enough, once one had
the clew; yet so extraordinary was the story
that it aroused my wonder. In no other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>country than half-civilized Brazil, I reflected,
could such a drama have been enacted.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we returned to the house we passed
the window of Valcour’s room and paused
to look through the open sash.</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl was awake and apparently much
better, for she smiled brightly into the face
Paola bent over her, and showed no resentment
when he stooped to kiss her lips.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <span class='large'>THE GIRL I LOVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was long ago, that day that brought
Liberty to Brazil and glory to the name
of Miguel de Pintra. Fate is big, but
her puppets are small, and such atoms
are easily swept aside and scattered by the
mighty flood-tide of events for which we
hold capricious Fate responsible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet they leave records, these atoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember how we came to Rio—Valcour,
Lesba, Paola, and I—and how Paola
was carried through the streets perched
upon the shoulders of the free citizens, while
vast throngs pressed around to cheer and
strong men struggled to touch the patriot’s
hand and load him with expressions of love
and gratitude. And there was no simper
upon Paola’s face then, you may be sure.
Since the tragedy at Bastro’s that disagreeable
expression had vanished forever, to be
replaced by a manliness that was the fellow’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>most natural attribute, and fitted his fine
features much better than the repulsive leer
he had formerly adopted as a mask.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valcour, still weak, but looking rarely
beautiful in her womanly robes, rode in a
carriage beside Francisco and shared in the
fullness of his triumph. The patriots were
heroes in those early days of the Republic.
Even I, modest as had been my deeds, was
cheered far beyond my deserts, and for
Lesba they wove a wreath of flowering
laurel, and forced the happy and blushing
girl to wear it throughout our progress
through the streets of the capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fonseca invited us to the palace, where
he had established his headquarters; but
we preferred to go to the humbler home of
Captain Mazanovitch, wherein we might
remain in comparative retirement during the
exciting events of those first days of rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterward we witnessed the grand procession
in honor of the Dictator. I remember
that Fonseca and his old enemy Piexoto
rode together in the same carriage, all feuds
being buried in their common triumph.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>The bluff general wore his most gorgeous
uniform and the lean statesman his shabby
gray cloak. And in my judgment the
adulation of the populace was fairly divided
between these two champions, although the
Dictator of the Republic bowed with pompous
pride to right and left, while the little
man who was destined to afterward become
President of the United States of Brazil
shrank back in his corner with assumed
modesty. Yet Piexoto’s eyes, shrewd and
observing, were everywhere, and it may be
guessed that he lost no detail of the day’s
events.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paola should have been in that procession,
likewise, for the people fairly idolized
the former Minister of Police, and both Fonseca
and Piexoto had summoned him to join
them. But no; he preferred to sit at Valcour’s
side in a quiet, sunlit room, effacing
himself in all eyes but hers, while history
was making in the crowded streets of the
capital.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required many days to properly organize
a republican form of government; but
the people were patient and forbearing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>their leaders loyal and true; so presently
order began to come out of chaos.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meantime Valcour mended daily, and
the roses that had so long been strangers
to her pale cheeks began to blossom prettily
under the influence of Francisco’s loving
care.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were happy days, I know; for
Lesba and I shared them, although not so
quietly. For the dear girl was all aglow
with the triumph of Liberty, and dragged
me as her escort to every mass-meeting or
festival and every one of the endless processions
until the enthusiasm of her compatriots
had thoroughly tired me out. The
Liberty of Brazil bade fair to deprive me of
my own; but I bore the ordeal pretty well,
in Lesba’s society.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came a day when I obtained my
reward. Valcour had made a quick recovery,
and now needed only the strengthening
influence of country air; so one
bright morning we all boarded a special
train and traveled to Cuyaba, reaching
safely the de Pintra mansion in the early
evening.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Nothing seemed changed about the dear
old place, which I had already arranged to
purchase from Dom Miguel’s executors.
Pedro had resigned his position as station-master
to become our major-domo, and the
thoughtful fellow had made every provision
for our comfort on this occasion of our homecoming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Mazanovitch was with us. He
had retired from active service to enjoy
his remaining years in his daughter’s society,
and although he seldom allowed
one of us to catch a glimpse of his eyes,
the face of the old detective had acquired
an expression of content that was a distinct
advantage to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had chosen to occupy my old room off
the library, and early on the morning following
our arrival I arose and passed out into
the shrubbery. Far down the winding
walks, set within the very center of the vast
flower gardens, was the grave of Dom
Miguel, and thither I directed my steps.
As I drew near I saw the square block of
white marble that the patriots had caused
to be erected above the last resting-place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of their beloved chieftain. It bore the
words</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“MIGUEL DE PINTRA</div>
    <div class='c002'>SAVIOR OF BRAZIL”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and is to this day the mecca of all good republicans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lesba was standing beside the tomb as
I approached. Her gown was as white as
the marble itself, but a red rose lay upon
her bosom and another above Dom Miguel.
She did not notice my presence until I
touched her arm, but then she turned and
smiled into my eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Savior of Brazil!’” she whispered
softly. “It is splendid and fitting. Did
you place it there, Robert?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” I answered; “the credit is due to
Piexoto. He claimed the privilege for himself
and his associates, and I considered it
his right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear uncle!” said she; and then we
turned reverently away and strolled through
the gardens. Every flower and shrub lay fair
and fresh under the early sun, and we admired
them and drank in their fragrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>until suddenly, as we turned a corner of the
hedge, I stopped and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lesba, it was here that I first met you;
on this exact spot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I remember,” said she, brightly. “It
was here that I prophesied you would be true
to the Cause.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And it was here that I loved you,” I
added; “for I cannot remember a moment
since that first glimpse of your dear face that
my heart has not been your very own.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She grew sober at this speech, and I
watched her face anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me, Lesba,” said I at last, “will
you be my wife?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And go to your country?” she asked,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All my interests are there, and my people,
as well,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I cannot leave Brazil,” she rejoined,
positively; “and Brazil needs you,
too, Robert, in these years when she is
beginning to stand alone and take her place
among nations. Has not Fonseca offered
you a position as Director of Commerce?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Yes; I am grateful for the honor. But
I have large and important business interests
at home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But your uncle is fully competent to
look after them. You have told me as
much. We need you here more than they
need you at home, for your commercial connections
and special training will be of inestimable
advantage in assisting the Republic
to build up its commerce and extend its
interests in foreign lands. Brazil needs you.
<em>I</em> need you, Robert! Won’t you stay with
us—dear? For a time, at least?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Well, I wrote to Uncle Nelson, and his
reply was characteristic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I loaned you to de Pintra, not to Brazil,”
his letter read. “But I am convinced
the experiences to be gained in that country,
during these experimental years of the new
republic, will be most valuable in fitting you
for the management of your own business
when you are finally called upon to assume
it. You may remain absent for five years,
but at the expiration of that period I shall
retire from active business, and you must
return to take my place.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>On those terms I compromised with
Lesba, and we were married on the same
day that Valcour and Francisco Paola became
man and wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should have married you, anyway,”
Lesba confided to me afterward; “but I
could not resist the chance to accomplish
one master-stroke for the good of my country.”
And she knew the compliment would
cancel the treachery even before I had kissed
her.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I have hinted, these events happened
years ago, and I wonder if I have forgotten
any incident that you would be interested to
know.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dom Miguel’s old home became our
country residence, and we clung to it every
day I could spare from my duties at the capital.
It was here our little Valcour was born,
and here that Francisco came afterward to
bless our love and add to our happiness and
content.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Paolas are our near neighbors, and
often Captain Mazanovitch drives over with
their son Harcliffe to give the child a romp
with our little ones. The old detective is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>devoted to the whole noisy band, but yesterday
I was obliged to reprove Francisco
for poking his chubby fingers into the captain’s
eyes in a futile endeavor to make him
raise the ever-drooping lids.</p>

<p class='c000'>The five-year limit expired long since;
but I have never been able to fully separate
my interests from those of Brazil, and although
our winters are usually passed in
New Orleans, where Uncle Nelson remains
the vigorous head of our firm, it is in sunny
Brazil that my wife and I love best to live.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
